Die hard fans will want a full sim, 100% race length, authentic damage and full customization of your car, more casual fans, or those who just want to jump in and play a quick 5 lap race also have that option. The weather factor is also cool as it greatly affects the tracks and how the car handles just like in real life and you really feel like you're driving on slick pavement. This isn't a game you can just go all out and bounce off the walls and keep going, your car will get destroyed and your race will be over.

I never played fallout 1 or 2. I however, fell in love with the game based off fallout 3 AND fallout new vegas. All the create your own path elements are completely removed from the game. As with many other games, when you \"simplify\" and \"streamline\" games that were already wildly popular, you are basically dumbing it down to the lowest common denominator, and ignoring the fact the game was wildly popular before without having done so. What once was a great game is ruined. The fact you could kill almost anyone was a reflection of the make any choice feel to the game. Now, 90% of NPCs are invincible, but are able to remember your bad actions and kill you even after you have respawned from the fact they just killed you. No weapons are armor degradation. Boring repetitive dialogue wheel. I would rather have kept no voice for more depth of dialogue choices, outcomes, consequences, and funny responses. You could be whoever you wanted in the game, but of course with consequences. Now, besides your looks, every character is the same bland character at heart. Yes the previous fallout had general endings, but at least they were ranged based on what you've done and the kind of person you had been throughout the game. The things that made the game an enjoyable challenging, like actually have consequences and rewards to having certain special attributes, skills and perks, to weapons and armor degradation, to having to or choosing to alter your playstyle to fit your characters unique skill set and personality, was what made the game so immersive and made you feel as if you were a part of the game, telling your own story. I find the biggest irony to be that the game is rated mature but gutted out, dumbed down and simplified enough so that small children can follow along. The thrill of finally getting your hands on power armor midway or late in the game is quickly replaced by a deflated instant gratification of being in armor 20 minutes into the game. Yes the FPS elements are improved, the settlement idea is cool if that's your thing, and it makes the massive amount of random items more useful, but it also makes them potentially more annoying and tedious to collect. I could care less about the graphics, and even some of the bugs, if the story, choice and gameplay elements were as great as before. Bethesda failed to realize that the very same thing that allowed them to get away with what has turned out to be a massive hype train cash grab is exactly what they have abandoned. The overpriced McDonalds happy meal quality pip boy that needs a phone to work with the game, otherwise its a cheap fragile prop. The t shirts, the figurines, the collectors edition vault dwellers guide,  etc., etc., etc. this game was so commercialized from the beginning I should have seen the quality coming. No I have nothing against Bethesda, well at least not up until now. I never played and elder scolls, skyrim, or mass effect. But apparently this is a common theme from understandably pissed repeat victims of Bethesda. As much as the COD sheep crowd and professional critic crowd want to dismiss us as unpleasable, stuck in the past \"metacritic troll\" curmudgeons, this game is a siginificant downgrade to the series. I also find the critique of saying its a remastered  fallout 3 or a fallout 3 dlc to be too kind. Fallout 3 and IMO especially Fallout New Vegas, are superior in every way to fallout 4. The only way I will ever consider buying another fallout is if obsidian is put in charge of development again. Wasted money on a watered down disappointment, that sacrificed the awesome intricacies for superficial \"mass appeal upgrades\" like a voiced character and improved FPS elements. Sadly and ironically the game already had mass appeal without these horrid \"tradeoffs\" and now in my opinion, never will have the same hype. Franchises always do this. Ditch what made you an awesome game in order to have more mass appeal, but in the end never realizing that what you chose to ditch is exactly what gave you mass appeal. People don't buy franchise games because of how much they are exactly like other franchise games. They buy franchise games because they are their own unique game, yet they are similar to other games in the franchise, but with improvements, without detracting from or sacrificing old elements that made the game a thrill in the first place. If I want to see COD elements in every game, I will keep playing COD. If I want to see GTA in every game, I will keep playing GTA. If I want to see fallout elements in every game, well I guess I cant play FO4, I need to go back to new vegas or FO3. People don't buy different games to keep playing the same generic game with different studios and names plastered on front of the game.

At times, a subtitle already spoken will remain on screen after being spoken, while the audio voice of the characters continues on.

The hit detection on enemies while aiming down the sites is terrible.  Very often, buy aim site will be right on the enemy, but the shot doesn't hit.

You can vary your guns, collect, recycle, built, defend your camps, attack to take place and start new settlements, a lot of stuff."], ["Ozfer", "User", "3", "Overall I am somewhat disappointed in this game. There are many glaringly blatant issues that prevent it from being what they claim it is. First off the new conversation system is dumb. In every conversation you are given the same 4 options, yes, no, I dont know, or f--- you. Thats not choosing my destiny thats the same 4 cruddy choices over and over again. This really is a problem in the main story because no matter what you choose the game wont pick what side you are on until a big pop up box opens up and says \"if you go here you will be against so and so\" so the dialogue you chose has no importance whatsoever on the game outcome. Furthermore the story is BAD. It copies many elements directly from the old games. They jammed in liberty prime randomly to make a connection to fallout 3. The also randomly jammed in Dr Madison Li from fallout 3 and your character randomly starts asking about her and the brother hood oh steel guy knows your interested in her for some reason when you should not know her at all. Another problem with the story is the main saying \"war never changes\". After hearing it 50 times it gets really old. You cant start every game with it and end every game with it. It doesn't fit. At the end of the game there is no war so its randomly jammed in. In general the story and characters have no depth. As other people say the FPS dips under 30 at many points and the graphics are about the fallout 3-new vegas level. Also as many people have said there are MANY game breaking bugs. Some of them break the main story. One example is if your sided with the brotherhood and kill your son and all the people in the institute. Then not only is the institute still alive even if you kill all the people, but then when you teleport back the quest line picks up with the minutemen for no reason. Also there are even spelling issues in the dialogue, randomly floating objects, the fact you cant speak to 95% of people in the game like you used to be able to(they just say a generic statement and walk away). The fact that I have beaten the main campaign and there is only 1 real town compared to NV and FO3 that had plenty of settlements. The fact there is really only 1 radio station with a announcer that sucks. The fact that there are only like 10 radio songs and like 7 of them are from the old games. The fact the companions are awful and always get in the way(especially the dog in the beginning). The fact that you get power armor from day 1 and its not treated as a normal item so you always have to get in and out of power armor to do anything.  This game overall feels rushed, lacking, and not improved upon. The new VATS system is pure junk. Third person is bad in normal use, but since the new weapon sighs are so bad I find myself switching to third person in combat just to get the dot in the center of the screen to aim at so I can see what I am shooting(never used to be a problem). They directly took the fallout 3 give the people water scenario and turned it into give us power instead. 90% of the story is very predictable, and there are many important topics that never get addressed again. For one thing everyone complains how the institute takes people, kills people, and replaces them with synths. Then you get into the institute and they are peaceful and it is never mentioned again. The three main factions that duke it out (brotherhood railroad and institute) all have very short cited goals that are BAD. You either pick to go with the railroad who wants to kill the brotherhood of steel and the institute because they want to save ALL synths above peoples live (STUPID), the brotherhood of steel who wants to kill ALL synths an they want to kill the railroad and institute just because they dont trust anyone (STUPID), or the institute who want to kill the others just because they could be threatened  (STUPID).  Another problem is how the SPECIAL system is different and they dont tell you it changed before they make you stick with it. I put all my points into intelligence thinking I was going to be able to raise my skills fast like in the old games. Big mistake. Furthermore the new settlement crafting system is pure JUNK also. Its like minecraft randomly jammed into fallout. It doesn't fit and the game engine doesn't seem designed for it. The main story easily breaks because of it. In one part of the main story when you have to construct  the teleporter using the crafting system if you dont have everything lined up right you cant continue the story. Plus the game literally has to make you build all the stuff on the same electrical grid in  a weird way BECAUSE BETHESDA DIDN'T FIX THE BUGS. They literally have a charactuer that says \"build all the stuff on the same power grid becuase we didn't know how to code this part into the game right\" well thats pretty much what they said :P .

Being a Philosophy major, I'll help people understand the problems here. Fallout 4 is not a good game because it was created not with the content or art of the game in mind but the money. There is evidence to show, and in fact business/accounting majors are taught this phenomenon that happens globally, that when money becomes a reward for doing an action, intellectual involvement decreases as well as detail oriented work and consideration decreases. This corresponds to the game in that this was an anticipated blockbuster hit. Because the money came first probably since the marketing team oversees many projects within a company, the game lost what would have made it a \"True\" fallout game like that of New Vegas and 3. Intuitively, this is easy to see from the marketer's perspective, \"Do I pay this story writer three times more than I do now for a good story in this game and get payed less or do I just make sure the bells and whistles work long enough to make more money and cut out a story?\" Simple answer, the marketer is taught how to make money. Don't expect a mathematician to work with artists about how to make art theory more rigorous. Don't expect a theologian to try to give arguments against the existence of God. Don't expect the marketer to worry about the aesthetic value of Fallout 4 in dealing with choice, determinism, literature, story, and experience. He worries about cash. Extend this to other games. Call of Duty franchise after CoD4, League of Legends with not well thought-out champions, World of Warcraft after Wrath of Lich King with bland armor designs, dumbed down lore, etc... Bethesda will learn that people didn't come to see cheap county art fair drawings. We came to see the next piece of art that guides the gaming community and creators. Money is easily forgotten, but destruction of reputation is a deep scar.

The world itself looks drastically different depending on the time or day and weather, which in previous titles never changed.  The gunplay has been improved upon to where if you run out of action points shooting doesn't feel wrong and is actually quite fun.  The game world itself is jam packed with things to do around every corner, space has not been wasted here.  The crafting system and addition of settlements is receiving less praise than it deserves.  Thie entire world truely is a sandbox for you to mold and shape to you're liking, from the story to the actual physical environments.

Okay, so we all know the game's not perfect, and it did not live up to all of the hype, but in my opinion it's still very enjoyable. So there are lots of bugs and glitches which can get annoying or even not let you carry on with the game. This is one of the biggest problems with the game (I'm sure they'll patch them soon though). Many of the things they had previously promised were not included in the final product which kinda sucks. The story can feel dull at times and slow. The fact is that it's basically the same old thing as Fallout 3, just a different story and some new additions thrown in there. The graphics aren't great but they surely aren't terrible. Character's faces can look really ugly at times but everything else seems to be alright. And it's not like Fallout New Vegas was anything spectacular for 2010. The gunplay is very fun and pretty addicting, I have no complaints there, and the crafting system is pretty good (although sometimes it gets annoying when things don't fit into places correctly). Overall it is a good game, and a good addition to the Fallout franchise, but before you buy it you might want to wait until it is patched and up to standards. I don't agree with most of these ratings all at 0, and I know all those people aren't going to agree with me either, but I think the reason all these people are so butthurt about it is because there was way to much hype for this game, and the final product failed to meet that hype.

Fallout 4 is a huge step backward from New Vegas, and I think Obsidian should be the only company making Fallout games from now on.

Sure it has it's moments (like when telling a Mr.Gutsy to 'F*** off you crazy robot' which convinces it your an american citizen) but that's about it.  The charming moments that made up the other games, are notably rarer in this, and honestly only situational for some character.  Your options are also severely limited when it comes to dialog (seriously....4 choices, that's it?) and don't even show you what your going to say accurately.  Hell, some one made a mod, JUST FOR THAT.  Dynamic Dialogs are cool concept, but they make some aspects of the game notably less fun, like if your companion decided they need to talk with you, right now, while your running from a deathclaw.  The plot could easily be described as 'Bladerunner if it happened in the post apocalypse' and the lack of character build options by gutting out skills and changing the perk system to this....chart....is seriously disappointing.  Sure the combat bits are pretty good, but Fallout as a series has been a game with conflict/combat, not only about rushing to the next fight.  The scattering of legendary enemies/effects also makes legendary weapons feel less special, like...alot less special, than it did in the older games, and then the workshop dlcs that basically pay wall people to be able to craft ammo is terrible.

I had pre-ordered this game as soon as it was announced with the collector's edition, to be honest, I don't regret it all. I have been a fan of the franchise for 6 years, and have played Fallout (1), Fallout 3, and New Vegas, all of which I loved. But the game was not what I thought it would be. What bothered me the most, was the dumbing down of the dialog, less RPG-ness, and just the boring story. I am not going to tell you that FO3 had a great story, but you'd think Bethesda would've learned something from Obsidian with New Vegas. The story was just too linear, restrictive, and generic. There's not much space to use your imagination with your character, they are set individuals with set personalities. In NV (even FO3) if you wanted to make a psychopathic cowboy arsonist (or just a really evil person) it could make sense, here your character is a normal dude/ lady with an average life living in the suburbs, so it wouldn't add up. It also takes away from the immersive-ness. As for dialog, your options are yes, no, sarcastic, and ask question. This was the most annoying thing, considering previous FO games had many options, some even requiring skill level in barter, guns, speech, etc. FO4 just color indicates an option (based on your charisma) that may/ may not give you XP, no actual number or percentage. The change in perk/ skill system does not bother me so much because I like to play jack of all trades characters, but it may be more difficult for other types, especially with the harder to find ammo. I am hoping in the future that Bethesda does not dumb down dialog in the Elder Scrolls series. Character creation was uncomfortable for me but it's not bad. I prefer the sliders to be honest. Now, the game isn't bad but it wasn't as amazing as I'd thought it would be.  It felt like I was playing a continuation of FO3, with slightly better graphics, more weapon mods, armor mods, and settlement construction. As for glitches and frame rate, the frame rate gets cruddy every now. As for the glitches, I had a game breaking one when I made my second character but I just had to reinstall it to fix it.  Although I don't love this game as much as the previous ones, I have still put in a lot of hours. The game offers tons of hours in gameplay with pretty good side-quests and even just roaming around.

No real RPG elements meaning critical choices and decisions are often not present. Instead you get scripted set pieces and events that happen based  on your characters actions. Lack of variation in the environment; Every area looks similar to one other aside from buildings but there are some exceptions like the Glowing Sea or Boston Common. The factions present in the game, Bethesda tried their best to make them varying but they are all pretty much after the same goals. Ironically Fallout 4 actually left me feeling no connection to the Commonwealth as the choices I made neither changed the map, territory of certain factions or  the weather. The only thing that actually changed was settlements. Settlements, limitless simple tasks to gain area to craft and rest but that's pretty much it. In earlier games like Fallout New Vegas if you were to adventure into the open you would stumble on an interesting scene or battle however in Fallout 4 this is more rare and more likely you will be attacked by a legendary creature before you actually got to see something interesting. The lack of weapons and clothing should also be noted as most of the weapons present in the game is a type of pistol; The actual interesting weapons such as Laser Guns or Energy Weapons are rare and either look unattractive sound annoying or both. The assault and combat rifles look bland and dull, Few interesting or varying weapons, which is a real deal-breaker for me. Combat actually feels devolved from the last games and less immersive. Armors usually range from small sets of items that you can equip on your body but there doesn't seem to be any variation aside from color or material and the cool looking glowish or flamed clothing  in no where to be found. Cloth is awful on it's own so lets not go into that cause of lack of casual or modern attire, lack of any powerful combat armor that doesn't look like a robot, lack of attractive faction attire.  You run out of ammo very fast and need to constantly switch weapons or find some. Mods do not turn the game into a new experience the most mods can do is create interesting new weapons and settlements but that's about it. A.I mods are decent but could be better as followers disappear  and all environment mods due is add vegetation. Most mods require some type of DLC to work and Sony refuses to allow any real changes to come to this already short lived game.  Fallout 4 is immensely boring and the developers do little to change this throughout your \"journey\" through the Commonwealth you will kill, fight, eat, sleep, die, help and that's it the main story line can be captivating some times but falls to certain cliches like \"you must have x amount of x to complete this quest. Some characters are likable but other annoy the hell out of you and make you want to kill them. Fallout 4 also does a horrible job of \"splitting the story\" as in creating your own arcs or alternate missions cause these only include help the x settlement defend x OVER and OVER. Or go fetch x from x! it's mediocre to it's core what we wanted was some epic adventure story with awesome enemies and weapons we did not get this. Fallout 4 could have done more to improve the game like add more weapons and perks but they choose not to.  The devs failure to innovate outside of DLC has dramatically reduced Fallout 4's replay value. Certain situations where you should be able to intervene are not present and instead you are given simple scripted events like help x fight x! It is a disappointment to say the least.

The gun play is also exceptional and very smooth. I prefer the new V.A.T.S system over the old. The loot is well rewarding and the modifications you can make to your guns and armor are very in depth. The power armor is also great. It allows you to fight creatures like behemoths or death claws that might be to hard for you at your specific level and kill them to reap the rewards.

It would be pretty easy to have a single line of dialogue as you increase your completed missions for an area. If you are going to complete several missions for each area, I think there should be more attacks on the area that test the defense you have spent your time and loot creating.

The old computers in this futuristic wasteland clunk along slower than my 1992 PC (R.I.P.). Both the computer and Pipboy screens should have been colorized, in my humble opinion. Having more fluid movement in 3rd-person view would have been nice too. The game is still a lot of fun and I keep wanting to get back to the story to discover what will happen next.

Characters starts talking to each other which makes it more alive. Example. Cobblesworth talking with Sturges. This was not a cutscene, that was in game. I was surprised when I saw that happened. The character developement was so good and I am not talking about 5-6 people. Lot's of people have their own personalities which makes the game so unique. The world looks awesome after the war and the guns are fun to use.  i gave it 9/10 because of FPS drops (Frames per Sec) went down to a 1 frame sometimes and some bugs do happen.

As a person who tends to end up skipping through a lot of the endless dialogue in previous Bethesda games it's refreshing to be able to just watch and hear the dialogue instead of reading everything. I do not feel that this is anywhere near the problem that people are making out, voice acting is decent and I am enjoying the storyline so far. I love the settlements feature, first thing I did was spend ~5 hours making the basis for my fort, it's very in depth for an optional feature and adds a great element to Fallout, I feel like I'm conquering the wasteland as I progress. I think the graphics look fine, sure it's not got the best graphics but I think the art style and weather/lighting makes up for this giving some impressive views from time to time. As for the new levelling system, it's simplified yet also expanded, there's no skills any more, just 10 perks for each letter of your SPECIAL. Each perk has multiple ranks and can give various different effects for each level, quite a few are just increased percentages e.g. rifles do 20% more, 40% more, while others are tied to your gun mods/settlements/crafting, radiation resistance etc. All in all it works well and though some people think this is a negative point I once again find it an interesting change, after all switching up mechanics helps the game to feel fresh. On to the crafting system, it's excellent, they have really built on the system set by Obsidian in a great way, you can mod your guns (and your armour) far more than in New Vegas, in fact, far more than in any other game I have played. Unique weapons dropped by legendary enemies also have some cool effects, I got a revolver which shot .45 ammo but also added 10 points of plasma damage, or a rifle that did +50% damage to humans and also armour pieces with 15% less damage from supermutants etc. It's always a great feeling to get unique gear with a great effect, really good feature that wasn't present in previous games. The soundtrack is brilliant, protip: Always keep the radio on. Returning favourites from Fallout 3 and the new additions fit the style perfectly. Radiation now actually matters, in Fallout 3 and NV I really didnt pay much attention to radiation, it debuffed my stats a bit but was never particularly noticeable. Now if I'm getting major rads I definitely know about it when my health is reduced to 50%, being used to this kind of mechanic from playing From Software games I prefer it this way and think it was a good move. Early on there was moments where I was praying for a radaway. The radiation storms look badass also.

Yes Bethesda has seen fit to remove some rpg oriented features shown in previous titles such as skill points (which i do sorely miss) to focus on a more stream lined game that appeals to a wider audience, but in doing so leaves you with an action heavy shooter rpg hybrid were the story and dialogue sort of puts the player in a position were you ask yourself  \"Do I actually care about these people or their lives?\" and for the most part you don't.

Are you serious right now?!  Now I've only put about 5 hours into this game so far, but SERIOUSLY?!  The only reviews I'm seeing are \"Omg the graphics suck totally deserves a 0/10!\"  Okay not only are the graphics FINE, but that shouldn't effect your opinion of the game!!!  Now I have issues with the game for sure: I agree with many of you that the world does feel a bit empty, quite a few gameplay mechanics feel rehashed from Fallout 3, the dialogue system is... let's be honest here the dialogue system is by far the worst out of any Bethesda game at least the one's I've played (Arena, Morrowind, Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Skyrim all have better dialogue systems) and from what I've played of it the story will not be the reason I stick around.  Yes all of these are issues, and yes the game is fairly glitchy, but not NEARLY as glitchy as many games I have played this early on in release, I have encountered no game-breaking glitches and any glitches I've encountered have been second long missing textures (in fact I've only found one of those) and some lag issues that again only last a second or two however lag happens pretty often.  However the good things heavily outweigh the bad things in the game.  First of all: FREAKING CRAFTING!  A genuinely good crafting system in a AAA open-world sandbox game.  Weapon customization which from what I've seen works very well, absolute base building (as in walls and defenses) interesting creatures, VERY much improved combat, and I wasn't gonna include NV in this review as it is not from BGS themselves, but it is a FAR better combat system that we've seen in both 3 and NV and the best combat I've seen in a Bethesda game.  The cinematic moments are done very well and feel a lot more satisfying than in 3, NV, and Skyrim, power armor works VERY well, but is a little annoying how quickly the power runs out luckily you can still use it, but it's... kinda pointless to as it slows to a near halt and disables bashing and sprinting.  Though the world feels a bit empty (so far, I've only seen less than a quarter of the map and haven't actually taken the time to get a good look at it) it is VERY well crafted and designed feeling real with all the hills, holes, lakes, rivers, trees, etc.  The missions in my opinion are very fun and challenging there's SO MANY weapons, the companion system works very well, and all in all it really is a fantastic game.  I'll admit (as a huge fanboy of Bethesda) I was hoping for a 10/10, so I am fairly disappointed in the game so far, but that's really just considering what I thought it would end up being.

Although it is not without it's problems. First off, the graphics look good, a huge step from F3 and FNV, but this isn't the technical powerhouse of the year. Also there is a lot of frame rate stutters, something regular to Bethesda releases. I have personally not seen a single crash or game breaking bug after 50+ hours. The games aesthetic is fairly weak, the Commonwealth is on a Skyrim level of boring. For such a massive game full of content, the world is very lifeless outside of the center region with almost every area feeling incredibly copy pasted from the last. Overall the repetitive nature of the map makes the commonwealth weak compared to the Capital waste or even the Mojave waste, this is from someone who put 100's of hours into those two games, 50+ leading up to F4 launch for comparison. But where the game does shine is in the quest lines. The main quest starts out fairly slow but takes a turn for more interesting matters later on. But even greater are the side quests. Many are easily some of the best in the series and make searching copy pasted areas full of Diablo tier random **** loot drops you'll never use actually worth the time. The new features, well they work for what they are but you mostly have to work around them. Crafting is incredibly limited but is put behind huge walls of grinding to make up for how shallow it actually is, and settlement building is only for those who are willing to spend 100's of hours strictly crafting. Most of the time I found myself having to work around the games limitations only to get bored and give up on creating settlements. Overall the game is very good, I can see myself possibly doubling my playtime, especially with promises of extra content in the coming months, but with all the hype surrounding I am still a bit disappointed by the games short comings.

My one major problem with Fallout 4 is the dialogue system I miss New Vegas with its silent protagonist and multitude of choices in the iconic Fallout style. Bethesda made a huge blunder with a voiced protagonist because each quest requires far more work accounting for the shortage in the main game as of now. If Bethesda had left this feature out perhaps they could have used their time to add in more side factions like in New Vegas where some groups like the Boomers or Khans were not essential for an ending. These down sides did not effect my enjoyment in the game and though I do hope future DLC will give the game a fuller feel I would recommend this game to everyone."], ["Alec101101", "User", "8", "The newest fallout game is outdated engine wise but a lot of the mechanics than make it new and fresh to all fans"], ["noahbruhh", "User", "10", "This game made me truly feel lost, and I loved every second of it , there are so many complaints about graphics and technical problems but the game crashed less times than BO3 did for me ( on ps4) I think this game is true accomplishment and would ABSOLUTELY recommend it"], ["TheTrurth", "User", "8", "Great game if you like role playing games but it is defiantly flawed.

The opportunities for growth remain the same: the graphics are nowhere near class-leading and there can be some bugs here and there that will irk you a bit.  I still adore this game and the franchise as a whole.  The Xbox One version comes with Fallout 3 as well (courtesy of backwards compatibility), so there's a much bigger value there for newcomers or those of us that like to retreat history.  But for Fallout, the only way to make the game feel bigger/better is continued excellence of storytelling on top of a more immersive world, which is hard to do when you're making sacrifice after sacrifice for graphics.  Bethesda really need to retool their graphics engine to really bring these wastelands to life.

Sure the graphics arent the best in the business compared to other games and RPGS of this generation (Witcher 3, Far Cry 4 etc.) but its still god damn beautiful in its own way, and it plays oh so smoothly.

You decide how you want your character to play and act, whether it be stealthy, melee only, or run and gun. This game is nonlinear in the most beautiful of ways, giving the player complete control. Each environment is a treat to explore and the player is rewarded heavily for searching every nook and cranny of buildings and areas. Items are scattered about the wasteland, and each has the potential to be useful. With the new building and crafting system, Bethesda has made it so that any single piece of gear, armor, or junk can be broken down into materials that can be used to upgrade guns and armor, or build various items for settlements.

I myself have been thoroughly enjoying this game and would recommend buying it if you enjoy these types of games. my only complaints are the abysmal framerate drops that will hopefully be addressed in future updates and the underwhelming dialogue system that has been dumbed down significantly from previous games. as far as graphics and animations go i give it a pass. The only real improvement over previous entries is a little more detail in textures and of course the 1080p update. The only wow factor that makes the graphics pop for me personally is the lighting effects. I noticed nobody mentioned the absence of an in game brightness adjustment option as well but i believe this shouldnt present a problem if your tv is properly calibrated although i do believe the option should be included. I really cant recall any game ive ever played not having one so i just found it odd and worth mentioning.

The quests (pretty much from everyone you meet) are the same over, and over, and over again.  Go here kill these ghouls, raiders, or super mutants.   If not that then it's go here and get (insert weird piece of technology here).  For the most part though, I enjoyed my time with Fallout 4 but not enough to do another play through.  There is a lot more color now, so everything doesn't have that greenish brownish hue.  I wasn't sure at the start if I liked that or not only because Fallout 3 really looked like several nuclear bombs went off, thus ensuring that apocalypse look and feel.  The color is actually kinda nice.  The gun play was also changed up a little bit making it a little less aggravating than previous titles, not to mention the addition of legendary weapons, and armor.  Legendary armor more or less give you buffs to stats like intelligence, and charisma.  Whereas legendary weapons add buffs like fire damage, or extra damage to specific types of enemies.  Now about those dialogue choices.  In my opinion dialogue choices in previous fallout games drastically effected how the game would play out.  In Fallout 4 however, it felt as though I could either be nice as hell or a sarcastic nice as hell **** and it never REALLY changed the outcome.  Sure, I could be kind of an **** and the character might not like me but they would still do the exact same thing if I was nice but instead have a good opinion of me.  I didn't feel like there were any real consequences to any of my choices.  That said, playing the same types of fetch or kill missions don't really give you a chance to be evil or good.

Like Skyrim, the game was littered with bugs upon release and theres some areas of the game that look extremely ugly (one area being some quarry where I had to drain the water. I looks as good as some areas of Half-Life 2). I'll admit that at times the world does look very good, and this is usually when the sun is setting or during a storm.

This game certainly has no lack of content but it lacks challenge as long as you have any sort of armor and not a pipe pistol. The amount of content is made by how much of this you do: \"General, we've just gotten word that another settlement needs our help\" or \"The commonwealth has no shortage of abominations when you're ready to go clear a place out just let me know\" What I'm trying to say is the content gets repetitive and boring really quick.

To give a bit of background, I am an older and very new gamer, who got the bug about 18 mnths ago. In that time I've played a stack of games exhaustively, and have had a great time, but none compares, for me, to the enjoyment I've had from FO4. I've played it through 3 times, each time going up a difficulty, and never stopped being enthralled. Let me be straight - it is far from perfect. It is VERY glitchy for one thing. (Carla...get your damn Brahmin OUT of my living room!).The dialogue can be disappointing and it's particularly annoying that you often have no idea what your character is going to come out with, as the very cryptic options you're given don't cover it. As a new gamer I can't speak for how good the combat is compared to anything else, but I've found the weapons have a variety of different 'feels' and seem very response to me, I've enjoyed playing around with the many weapon choices and finding my own style, used VATS a lot and, as I've improved, enjoyed not using it too. The main story line isn't epic but good enough that I've been able to play it through three times without getting too bored, and some of the companions and their story's have been utterly engrossing and moving (I'm looking at you Nick Valentine). In fact, the NCP's are in general a likeable bunch and having them around has added a lot to the experience. And there's Dogmeat, what could be better? Other than his propensity for occasionally getting lost - I once spent a whole week, in real time, frantically searching or him in every available moment I had - he is the perfect doggy sidekick and I actually miss him when I return to real life! I've really got into modding the weapons and armor and have had the most fun playing with my power armor collection. The HUGE side story of this game is the settlement building, which for the substantial community of players that have embraced it, is endlessly engrossing and fun, and for that alone you can keep coming back to this game and have new stuff to do, bigger and better settlements to build. Shame about the settlers themselves who are a totally uninspiring bunch who do little but moan and stand on the roof at inopportune times. I wish they could have been better, Bethesda. It's frustrating to have built a fantastic bar/restaurant with all the amenities, great lighting, decor, music etc. for that miserable bunch of gits to sit there like a wet weekend. I'm surprised at people who have complained about the graphics because they may not be the Witcher 3, for example, but are still plenty good enough and I have often found myself stopping in the midst of game play to marvel at the view from the top of Corvega...or from the balcony of my home in Sanctuary Hills. To me, this game is what gaming is all about, something with a bit of heart as well as a fair bit of running around shooting stuff, plenty to explore and a fantastic range of environments to do it in, and good company to do it with. It seems to me that so much of the negative feedback on this game is from people who liked Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and clearly Fallout 4 is a different thing. Shame though, for it to cast such a pall on such an epic contribution for what is isn't rather than acknowledging what it is.

Having said that, I didn't love the DLC's quite as much and was pretty disappointed in several of them. Far Harbor is by far my favourite one. The environment is atmospheric and beautiful in a very dark, dank and gloomy sort of way. There's some terrific new story lines, particularly one involving one of my favourite NCPs from the main story, and quite a bit of new gear that's a great addition to my collection - including a nice set of distinct power armor and one of my top three favourite guns in the whole Fallout 4 world. Far Harbor is a BIG addition, and provides a lot more world to explore and more settlements to build if you're into that (which I am, in a big way!), so as I had a handful of thriving settlements here, even once I'd finished all the quests and story lines I was still travelling back and forth to maintain my settlements there, and it integrated well into my game ongoing. I have never had any problems with the frame rate or crashing that other people have mentioned.

Many options to finish the missions and solve the conflict, as well as cool enemies and atmosphere, if FO4 would have has the same amount of options in the game, it would have been the best in the series. Why then an 8? Well - my MAIN disappointment in about the main game is that, once the quests are over, there are relatively little enemies and/or INTERESTING side missions to do, so all you can focus on is settlements - which are nice - but don't add much in terms of combining well with the rest of the game. So if you want to have many enemies to kill and get legendries, there are not too much, and once you get to level 80 or so, the remaining enemies can't really harm you much, even at very hard difficulty level. This persists in Far Harbor, the missions are great, the island is haunting, and the weapons and factions are nice, but once it's over, it's the same thing as the main game, a limited quantity of things to do, aside form settlements. If Bethesda had offered more enemies (in terms of numbers, and spawn locations) as well as more entertaining side missions (instead of go kill these raiders) - then I would have given it a 10. As it stands, FO3, with the expansions also had limited things to do, but the wasteland in that game felt more dangerous, and the enemies kept up with you - it seems having a level cap, paradoxically is a good thing, as it prevents you from getting too strong, while the perks are MUCH better. Overall, however, the factions in Far Harbor, the numerous ways to play this DLC, and the interesting storyline, especially with Valentine as a companion, is very, very good - I also was once of the relatively few group of people who enjoyed the puzzle quest - make this DLC, perhaps the single best DLC Bethesda has made for any Fallout, on par with F03's Broken Steel, maybe even better, because of the options that are allowed in game..

Ajay quickly finds out that she may have had an ulterior motive in sending him here.

The world opens up and gives you the tools and skills to murder, destroy, and dominate the region. Modern day video game storytelling, especially with a genre like first person shooters that boosts countless killing, has become quite efficient at easing your character into this brutal personality. Bioshock Infinite reveals that you are a war veteran within the opening scene, immediately telling you that you are capable and have dealt with killing a human being. The Last of Us establishes Joel as a man broken by the world and thus cold to death. Every Call of Duty and Battlefield puts you in a role of a person whose duty is to kill.

The first and most obvious is the story which is just really short and boring. I won't say much more but if you've seen the trailer you've seen practically the entire story to be honest. Second the AI was extremely disappointing for me. Not for the people, I expect cave men to be dumb but the animals. Since this game is as hunting focused as it is action focused I expected animals to have realistic AI like stalking as packs and moving as herds. Animals are just the same as they always have been though if they see you they charge at you. And at night... ugh. The trailer said the predators would be dangerous which led me to believe they might just follow you in the shadows and wait for a moment until you're vulnerable. Not so, instead it means a pack of wolves spawns every 20 ft so you are literally fighting 6 packs of wolves per night every night. It kind of makes doing anything else at night a lot less enjoyable. The third and the biggest problem with the game I find is the crafting system. It seems like very little thought was put into this area because you can grind through everything in 10 hours if you want too. The fact there is no customization of weapons at all is painful to me. I imagined getting to paint my bow and maybe have a few carvings to pick from to put on it, some feathers, gemstones maybe, bones but you literally get 3 bows in the game. NO SIGNATURE WEAPONS like wtf?I only really ever use one bow and it looks hideous? That doesn't sound like Farcry...

Well, I can tell you...this game a good game, honestly. It has it's flaws, but at it's core it's a good game. Honestly, I'm not sure why Ubisoft had to make it a Far Cry game. If they had just announced it as a new IP, they could've done so much more with it. They could've changed the formula, made it a bit different rather than somewhat of a re-skin of Far Cry 4. But, with that aside, this game is very good. The story does lack a bit and the characters really lack complexity, but the rest of the game is very good. The game is utterly beautiful. The graphics are perfect for this game. The scenery is captivating, but also very brutal. And the hunting aspects would have to be the best in the series so far. While you're running around the world, you feel much more vulnerable than you would in a game like Far Cry 4. In Far Cry 4, if you run into an animal that isn't friendly and starts to attack you, you can blow it up or shoot it down where it stands. But in Primal, you have to be much more careful. Due to your lack of machine guns and RPGs, you only have spears, a bow, clubs, throwing knives, ect. This causes you to have to be more careful, because if you run into something like a bear, you're basically screwed. The game also added a new \"Hunter Vision\" as I like to call it, where you press in the left stick and everything turns grey except for key things. Plants, materials, and animals all get highlighted in yellow, and that makes hunting very fun and interesting. The crafting is also a very interesting thing now. Rather than just being able to buy things from vendors in previous Far Cry games, you now have to craft most of your arsenal of weaponry. Spears, arrows, throwing knives, and clubs all have to be crafted by different materials, which makes the game a lot harder than past Far Cry games as you have to be watching out for materials if you're starting to get low. Also, the side-quests aren't really anything too interesting. Usually it's just escorting 3-4 Wenja Tribesmen and women to another location and on the way you get ambushed at various spots by the Udam tribe. Or, the hostage missions, somewhat of a staple to the Far Cry series. I haven't really gotten too much into the beast taming, but from what I've seen it seems like a very awesome and interesting addition to this game. And the rest is basically anything else you would see in a Far Cry game. Instead of bell towers, there's bonfires. I was deciding whether or not to give this game a 8 or a 9, so I figured I would just say an 8.5 but round it up to a 9. This game is definitely worth your money if you're a fan of the past games. If you're just getting into the series, I would definitely recommend Far Cry 3 or Far Cry 4, because usually right now they're a lower price, and you may have troubles in this game if you aren't a veteran of the series yet."], ["Hollowfied", "User", "9", "Far Cry Primal Got to say all game  in previously where amazing good but this one is great but the must be a but in there"], ["Todd_Dow", "User", "10", "Great game!

You will also be able to tame wild beasts such as wolves and wildcats...and even sabertooth tigers. By doing so, the respective animal will stay by your side as a companion to give you an extra level of assurance when exploring or going into battle.

There needs to be some sort of button sequence or something that is actually difficult, and that actually gets harder depending on the level of beast you're taming.

It fits in the hand very nice and all the buttons are well laid out, except the touch button which lucky for us isn't needed in Farpoint. I love the aim controller and playing this game without it would of been a whole lot less fun. I would say the only down side is the drift some people have talked about which didn't happen to me, the going out of the play area which also didn't happen to me as pressing option button once and awhile help with placing. The story isn't half bad with a slow start, deep middle and ok ending. The graphics are good for a VR title and the usual blur is better in this title than others. (PS4 Pro) However it is bland and boring at times. The only time you get something amazing is when some event in the game has a purple wormhole spitting out alien mega space stations or you face of with a huge creature. The game play is OK but nothing special. shooting the same baddies that look like predator mated with a black window spider gets a little repetitive and it was very nice to see new enemies before I pulled my hair out of my ball sack of pure boredom. The aim controller was a pleasure to use. Shooting with the thing was so good I was fantasizing about what games could use this tool. At the moment I'm also playing Playerunknowns Battlegrounds and this aim controller and VR would make this game so needed. Anyway end fantasy.

The best guns by far are the assault rifle and shotgun, the first two weapons you get. The most fun enemies to fight are the Starship Trooper-esque giant spiders, which are replaced by robots and green alien men for the second and third acts. The story is pretty good throughout the first two acts, but stapled a third act on that added nothing to the story but made it much more confusing. And the greatest sin is that the game just ends, with no resolution. You fight through a bunch of regular enemies (some of whom get insta-kill attacks towards the end), watch a cutscene that explains nothing and makes you furious at the characters, and roll credits.

Lastly, but most importantly, the gameplay. This is the least focused aspect of all. The central mechanic to the game involves rotating the 2D word by 90 degrees to see it from different angles. It is clever and original, and has huge potential for some clever puzzles and gameplay elements. Regrettably, this potential is completely unattained, and asides from a couple of simple uses of the mechanic which you quickly get used to, it is really just used as a stylistic element rather than an integral part of the gameplay, so that the game really just becomes a very bland platformer. It seems that the developers were either too incapable or lazy to turn the mechanic into an actual game, or else they simply failed to recognise its potential and focus on it. Instead, rather bizarrely, the gameplay slowly descends into obscure puzzles involving code breaking or noticing obscure parts of the environment. None of these puzzles are well-designed or enjoyable, and a number of them are downright bad. All in all, I did initially enjoy playing this game purely as an aesthetic experience, rather like the experience of peacefully observing a painting, so I can't give it a very low score, and you should give it a try if you are into that kind of thing. However, once you have had enough of the sensual experience, stop playing, as its artistic merits are woefully unmatched by its merits as a game. For this reason I can't give it a high score either. A score of 5 therefore seems appropriate."], ["catman1132000", "User", "10", "This game is a masterpiece.

The puzzles in Fez are quite well balanced, ranging from the simpler platforming puzzles needed to complete the story, all the way to extremely cryptic brain crunchers for the completionists.

There's Pro Clubs, Seasons mode, Co-Op seasons, Skill modes and the standard Career Mode for the original gamers. Plenty to be had. It's all noticeable through the vastly improved new animations which are evident through the whole match. Pure and true football fans will really appreciate the improvements, which makes use of the new Ignite engine and that is noticeable throughout. It introduces human intelligence enabling players to react like the real thing, more realistic player movements and more realism in the way the environment features, all of which are significant moving foreward for the franchise which based on PS3/360 were slowly stagnating but based on its PS4 debut it's very encouraging!"], ["lfcbraderz", "User", "5", "You can play co op seasons, but, while this is an improvement on Fifa 14 for the last generation of consoles. It most certainly isn't a patch on Fifa 13. The dribbling has effectively been abolished from the game but slowing the game down dramatically. If you don't do one touch passing then you can easily be defended against but the opposition player simply holding the A button and RB. The majority of online players simply put as many defenders at the back as they can and Press L1 and triangle on the counter. When you have speedy or strong players it's quite easy to get goals like this. Also momentum is very much still in the game you'll notice on the 45 and 90 minute mark goals seem to go in an awful lot. When its raining the physics of the game completely mess up and the game seems to run about 10 frames per second slower than usual. The netcode for the game is completely messed up now and Fifa unfortunately seems to be getting worse and worse, year upon year.

The fouls are completely random and if you're playing a videogame and your player falls without any action from the gamer, you just ask \"Why?\" while your player gets up slowly and you suffer a goal because of that.

Currently, it is a husk of latent unfulfilled potential, and is a treated as a blatant cash cow for a lumbering shambles of a company. They also treat their customers with disgrace. If you go to EA Sports forums, they have \u201cvent\u201d treads and any criticism you voice about the game is considered heresy pending a banned account and confinement in the Tower of London. What EA Sports had achieved in the past 10 years would have been easily surpassed by any another studio with more ambition and commitment like Bethesda. When buying a Fifa-EA product, I find myself paying through the nose for their monopoly on licensing & copyright rather than for entertainment. They drip feed 1 or 2 untested \u201cimprovements\u201d per year, most of which undermine smooth and consistent gameplay; their flagship features such as randomness, first touch passing and UFC style tackle/collision systems have totally lost the plot. This would be fine if it had been done correctly, but there is no consistency to the implementation here. The game lacks refinement and adding \u201crandomness\u201d to already poor gameplay makes for an extremely frustrating experience. The whole result seems like a rip-off of Madden or UFC. These professional \u201ccritical\u201d reviews seem to glorify each FIFA game in isolation of the 10 previous iterations before it, marketing each release as some sort of ground breaking & innovative affair; when in fact there is much less to like. According to EA, \u201cIt doesn't matter if you call it soccer or football, in the end all you need to know is that FIFA is the only way to play\u201d or so they hope!

I found it really hard to score on the older fifa's, but at least when you did you would score a good, hard earned goal, and in general if somebody beat you it was because they were better and didn't just have obafemi martins up front!

The game just feels better and is less frustrating because of it.  The crowd is more involved which ads to the atmosphere.  The more I play the more I notice the reactions to the play on the field.  Emotion of the players is a nice touch although I don't notice it as much as I would like. As a natural instinct  I tend to skip through the cut scenes so this could be why.  All the extra touches like the pitch wear and grass stains on players kits is a awesome addition.  I love playing in the rain now with the extra mud and slop.  Water spraying off the ball as its kicked and each step causes a splash.  All the attention to detail and added responsiveness to the players makes it much more enjoyable play than Fifa 14.

Although FUT is not the reason I buy FIfa I do enjoy playing it a bit and really never had to dump extra money into it.  The only issue I got with the game so far is something gamers have been Whining about on the Fifa forum.  It looks like anti- aliasing is turned off  which results in jagged edges.  Although I feel it is nowhere near game breaking it can be a bit distracting and is disappointing with all the extra attention to detail they put in.  Overall I'm really happy with Fifa 15 and feel it is a good improvement over last year.  Not a huge step forward but definitely heading in the right direction even with a case of the jaggies!"], ["Savante", "User", "0", "I can guarantee that you will want to break your controller while playing this game.

In this years version, EA has to continued to improve from the previous FIFA game on next gen. Its what you expected from a FIFA with the same basic mechanics as in the previous years.

First off, this game has loads of potential to be wonderful, and yet somehow EA have produced the single worst, most insufferable single player mode in FUT I've ever played. In truth, this isn't totally surprising since anyone who played FIFA 16 probably remembers the absurdity of playing on world class difficulty. Well this year, be prepared to face CPU opponents who play shockingly oppressive superhuman defenses: CPU players are always perfectly positioned; they don't fall for any skill move or trick; they can intercept every pass; they can block every shot;  and CPU player is faster, stronger, has better reflexes, and so forth, than all of your players (even if you have top players and the CPU opponent is a fourth tier English side). But best of all, the CPU NEVER gets called for a foul. Defenders will steam roll your players, obstruct you up and down the pitch, slide in from everywhere, and they will not be called for a foul. I've played over 60 offline matches and been awarded two direct free kicks, and the CPU wasn't even called for a single foul during the last two offline seasons I completed (that's 20 matches).

I thoroughly compared FIFA 17 and PES 2017 today and I have to say that, although it's true, PES's gameplay is more responsive in that a player will respond quicker to your input and maybe the animations are a bit better, ultimately the action on the pitch looks like it plays more realistically in FIFA. PES is a bit too hyper and chaotic. I like the slightly slower, more deliberate pace of FIFA. It's more realistic. That is a fact, watch any football match and you'll know. So how is that such a big issue to supposedly professional publications like IGN? Look, the responsiveness in FIFA 17 has gotten a bit better from 16, so there's that. The main issue for FIFA on the pitch is the lack of strategies having a major impact on play and artificial intelligence. EA must work on those. They also have to work on better player animations on and off the pitch. There are a lot of realistic reactionary animations in PES but I mean, obviously that's just icing. In regards to off the pitch animations the biggest complaint is facial animations. In FIFA they make the players look like robots. Refer to L.A. Noire or more recently Mafia 3. And it's annoying to see players arms going through other players' bodies, etc. However, I did notice players \"ice skating\" in PES but almost not at all in FIFA. The rest is obvious, licensing vs lack of licensing, FUT vs whatever. Overall FIFA is probably the better game. FIFA needs to focus more on the impact of strategy and AI, which, my guess is that they're closely related. So if you care about that then PES is your game, however, the more deliberate, realistically paced, more accessible game is FIFA. It would be great if FIFA worked on improving, especially facial, animations as well."], ["Zigwiz13", "User", "0", "ea needs to stop making you play a storyline throughout the game all this 90 min goals and other script stuff need to go is making people turn away from sports games"], ["SenoSaden", "User", "7", "Since everyone  is talking about the journey mode and its positive reception, I will focus only on the gameplay aspect.

The Journey is alright, but it's very scripted and repetitive, making it a one time experience with no replayability.

A completely different mode based around the rise of a young football player transitioning from a kid that kicks ball to a sports superstar. I am quite impressed by what EA delivered here, never thought they would put this much effort into it but they did and it has paid off in many aspects. Next time, they should make statistic tables available so we can see how well the protagonist is playing compared to the rest of the players in the league. Is he top scorer, is he topping the assists table, how many yellow cards has he received etc. Not being able to see Match Facts after a game is completed is nothing but an immature error on EA's part. They should also give the user the option to continue beyond the first season, minus the cut scenes. It feels like all the training is a bit of a waste. Having predetermined attributes like having low FK accuracy regardless of what position you play is also a far-sighted move. Not all strikers in real life are terrible at free kicks. I think a player type on top of being able to choose what position would have sufficed, like a shooter who's shooting stats are better than normal, a target man who's physical and heading stats are better than normal, or a player maker with good passing and vision stats etc. There's already more depth looking at it like this, which would no doubt improve the game mode. I also think the interview triggers and social media reactions need a lot of work, I could score two goals and bag an assist in one game and then the interviewer tells me I got one goal and an assist. If I bag a hat-trick, the reactions on social media are either non-existent or \"a goal from\" you, \"what a player\".

I have loved FIFA every year, but this year they have changed a lot in terms of game play. Players feel clunky and hard to maneuver, defense is made a lot harder to control than in previous years, AI is an utter tragedy as well as mostly unresponsive and unhelpful, and shooting is still ridiculously unlogical (even though it was a lot worse on first release but changed with update). The two main criticisms of the ones I named above are AI and shooting. Regarding AI, I understand that most of the game play should be controlled by the user, but in some situations  the AI should compensate for minimal errors carried out in the flow of game play. Some of the situations I have noticed are such that a pass that is maybe half a foot off target may often make it is as if the player completely ignores the pass altogether as if he isn't apart of the play or another situation such as an attacking player has beaten a user controlled defender but runs directly into the path of an AI controlled defender and this defender does nothing to stop the attacker. Shooting is the other criticism that is unrealistic at times. Players should not be able to do a complete 180 and be able to get perfect contact every time or be able to pull off unrealistic wonder shots from ridiculous angles with pressure on them. The only reason I am  giving this game a 3 instead of a 0 is because all of the available game modes, graphics, and overall presentation of the game are just as great if not better than any other FIFA in the past.

In EAs case, it is clearly obvious, that FIFA 18 is flawed on many levels - They have made little or no effort whatsoever to improve a cult game despite the resources that they will have at their disposal. In fact I believe the game to be a major step backward from fifa 17. The reality of the user reviews compared to critics reviews, rubber stamps the obvious fact that you guys merely re-word the same old reviews without actually exploring the game yourselves and you are obviously too worried about  ramifications of negative reviews from EA & Sony. There is little point in detailing the obvious flaws of the game; there are too many to list and we all know what they are. I have enjoyed FIFA for years , some versions more than others but I am shocked at the blatant laziness by EA to re-deploy the same themes & templates in different guises. Its almost as though they have dared to see how little effort they could put in whilst taking their loyal followers money. But the real culprits here are the critics - EA have just mugged us all off but the critics should have done the right thing and appraised the game for what it really is.

I would have to disagree.  I give all three entries in XIII a better score than this.  My main problem with this game has nothing to do with the port -- I've never been a big fan of how many characters are in your party and how fast they enter, without any establishment of personal stories or backgrounds.  It's a problem of 'too many cooks'.  One of my favorite aspects of RPGs is the deep, entrenching story and compelling and complex character establishment.  This game severely lacks the latter.  For the first 10+ hours, over half the team probably hasn't been in your party yet, and you may have heard 1-2 lines from most of them.  Honestly, it's hard to get connected to any of the characters because of that.  Fifteen playable characters is just wayyyy too many, even for a FF game. So that already was a problem for me -- however, the port introduced some new issues.  First of all, the cutscenes are anything but seamless.  I understand it's a port, but the 15 seconds of blank loading screens in between every 5-10 seconds of cutscene sometimes leaves something to be desired.  They really could have worked on just sewing some of the scenes together a little better, given they're now on XBONE/PS4. It would have given the story a better flow than the original offered. Lastly, porting to a new console generation gave them the opportunity to make the interface a little more clear, and they just plain failed to do that.  We're not on a five-inch screen anymore, so there's no reason for the big, blocky, messy interface it has.

T-0 HD is not the normal FF game, as it is more gritty and less colorful than previous titles. The game's story revolves around war, and how it is the young who die in war, not those who have the power to wage it, and the feelings of this are radiated in the fact that  the supporting cast outside of the 14 playable characters dwindle down little by little as the game goes on. Gameplay holds a basic 3 attack, 1 defensive ability locked to the four button layout. A nice add on is the killshot, which is a split second that occurs where a red circle appears. If damage is done during this split second, then the target dies, regardless of whether it's an opponent or a boss. The limitations of course are the biggest problems with the game.

At any rate, graphics are horrendous, interim gameplay is essentially nonexistent, the mission system makes no sense, the time cycle makes no sense, the leveling system is terrible and the inventory system is somehow combined with the skill system and that, unsurprisingly, makes no sense.

Expectations destroyed!"], ["Markolius", "User", "9", "This really is a beautiful game if you stay with it and give it a chance. It seems too complex, dull, and hokey at first. It's absolutely not for the casual gamer, who wants an ordinary campaign or a game they can jump right into. It takes time, but it pays off into an engrossing massive fantasy that relishes in your freedom of gameplay. After 20 hours, you should have a decent understanding of most aspects of the gameplay and be into the main quest. What was complex will become second nature, enabled largely by the intuitive PS4 controller. What was hokey or dull becomes very alive with solid lore that stays very true to the Final Fantasy classics. The game seems most influenced by FF I, II, and III (in the west). If you played these games when you were younger, you'll delight in seeing their evolved return in MMO form. There are so so many things that you can do -and perhaps the greatest achievement of the game- is that most of these things are actually quite fun. Navigating becomes realistic, combat becomes more strategical, and even things like crafting become truly entertaining in their gameplay. Being able to quest with every class on the same character really makes it interesting. Another great achievement is that it does not feel grindy or like you have to farm. Again, there is so much to do- you can just let your character explore or you can plan your objectives with goals in mind. The culture is excellent, join a nice Free Company, and the social element of the game also becomes a pleasure. The graphics on the PS4 are very good and really show the detail of the Final Fantasy artwork, which flows without delay everywhere you travel. The music is great and the lack of voice acting is, in my opinion, mostly a plus. I can't stand when you hear the same voice actors playing different characters in a game. Also, I can read much faster than they speak. Perhaps they could have been improved with some more voice acting in cut scenes, but for the most part, I prefer it as it is. With all that being said, there is nothing particularly mind blowing or ground breaking in the game. It still has its frustrations and repetitions, particularly in side quests. The plot is your standard Japanese anime about good versus evil, other dualities, and the need for balance. The dialogue is mostly well written and there is a ton of dialogue content. Personally, I hate the ye ole English style of the dialogue. The subscription price is warranted for the content updates.  It's just a solid Final Fantasy MMO. You can really choose to do whatever you want in this game. Nothing is forced.I t's a great game to enjoy for many hours - ultimately, for the freedom it gives."], ["DirtyBird13", "User", "10", "It is currently the best MMO for the console market right now.

As someone who was still in middle school when \"Versus XIII\" was announced and became increasingly excited over it's premise; I feel as though I waited long enough to expect a full, complete experience.  A decade passed: the title changed, the movie and anime were released, tidbits of combat and story footage were shown and needless to say everyone, including myself were beyond ready.  I'm not even a huge Final Fantasy fan in general, never really appealed to me but this one was different.  After starting the game, I was pretty engrossed for the first few hours.  The world was expansive and intriguing, characters seemed likable and the combat was flashy.  However, as the hours dragged on, so did my experience.  Personally, I was always more excited about the combat and exploration than the story.  But the latter proved to be nonsensical.  Minimalism is fine, but when taken to the extreme that is FF 15's delivery, it becomes problematic.  And the real shame is how much potential it had to be fleshed out.  The story itself isn't terrible, but the presentation is.  Even after watching the contextual media that proceeded it; there are countless gaps in logic, multiple times when vital characters leave the entire game for no apparent reason and it isn't explained, and main villains basically meet ill-fates without any exposition as to what happened or how they got to that point.  I will say, without spoiling anything, Ardyn was such a fantastic antagonist.  But he was the sole reprieve from an otherwise convoluted plot that wasn't given the time or energy it needed to really shine.  And \"DLC will fix it\" is unacceptable; a main story should at least have a plausible beginning, middle and end, especially for a game that was in development for so long and even received extra backstory before it's release.  The combat was also underwhelming.  The choice to not make triangle a secondary attack button for varying combos, or to even simply give your party different commands for different scenarios; the list goes on and on.  The latter really bothered me because that's where 99% of the game's challenge arose from, your invalid party members dying repeatedly in one or two blows later on in the game when you could've easily told them to \"defend\" when it seemed necessary.  Or to focus attacks on your target, etc.  Instead, they rush in constantly with no regard for any semblance of tactics and you have to keep reviving them over and over as a consequence.  It's not all bad, it can be fun to watch but holding down two buttons for the majority of your experience doesn't really constitute a \"deep\" overall system.  Directional attacks, summons and magic are all implemented pretty well and some of the boss fights are truly incredible.  Graphics and sound design are masterful for the most part and the dialogue isn't nearly as bad as I was thinking it might be.  The driving is also a mixed bag, while it gives you a chance to soak up the awesome scenery, it quickly becomes a lost novelty as you sit there for minutes on end with dead-silence.  The phrase \"it's just a shame\" resonates so heavily with so many factors of this game and it really is unfortunate.  Even comparing it to something such as Wild Hunt; it's night and day in terms of overall combat mechanics, story structure and character development.  I wanted so badly to enjoy this game but I am simply not understanding the praise this game is getting.  It may be a result of the hype, but when you really examine it, the overall experience is a shallow one.  It also only took me maybe 23 hours to beat while doing a decent amount of the primarily mundane side-quests.  Felt absolutely no inclination to go back to the game for any reason, traded it back the day I beat it.

The Developers created a story with such lack luster that they should be ashamed to call this title Final Fantasy.

It was apparent within the first 15 minutes of Final Fantasy XV that this was not going to be the case.

About 40 minutes later in the game it happened my father the king died in a less than epic fashion.  There was absolutely zero character development or emotion for the passing of my father.  In some strange way I was more relieved that my companions sister lived and was less concerned with the death of my own father the king to the empire.  I never really fell into the story of how now I am the king as the passing of my father happened.  I never felt the drama of my future queen and her departing.  In fact it was so clunky I had a hard time following the story.  I agree that the open world, side quests and dungeons are great but with the ultimate sacrifice of a compelling story that drives me.  I never felt connected to the story in a way that felt epic or made my heart skip a beat.

To many times during battle was ruined by **** camera angles usually my view was from behind a bush or rock.  The battle system was cool at first but becomes very easy once you figure out you basically attack and parry by mashing two buttons.

Somehow, I even would go to the extent of saying this game is one of my favorites of all time.  It is quite good, with a highly relatable cast, which I found surprising, I related most to Noctis, which I didn't see coming seeing as he is royalty, but when it comes down to it, he felt human, and suffered from many of the same human issues as anyone else.  Combat is fast and fun, there isn't a simple thing to compare it to, maybe something like bayonetta or devil may cry, but at the same time completely different.  My only issue with combat is it never challenges the player, and it never really grows, it gives you the entire tool kit at the beginning and it is really a skill and numbers game from then on.

The world is simply beautiful and exactly what you might come to expect from the FF series, but in a open world.  The later half of the game does go linear which is more of a strength to its story telling, although execution doesn't hit every beat in this later half.

I'm not fighting a level 99 monster (and I really like to fight optional bosses) just to be rewarded some BS. I did not like the ending boss fight at all. It didn't feel like a boss fight whatsoever. There was just no challenge to it. There are summons called Astrals that, unlike other FF games, you cannot summon whenever you want. They only appear for you when they, the Astrals, deem it necessary. Now to level up you have to rest at a hotel, motel, or camp site to accumulate all of your EXP which i hate! If you don't  do any of those things you will not level up. The openworld didn't feel like an openworld to me either. I couldn't just go anywhere I wanted like you can in GTA.

Do not get on the Damn Boat!  Once you get on that boat the game goes from a beautiful open world game with tons of things to explore and do, to an incomplete, boring, dark, depressing dungeon crawler.  Like many FF games there is a major event that occurs that completely changes the landscape of the world.  However, typically those games still allowed you to explore the world after the event and find and complete quests.  In this game you literally and figuratively get put on a train with a one way ticket to a very disappointing ending.  The story introduces a ton of interesting characters who are both good, evil or neutral.  Then the game completely ignores all but 6 of them.  For most of them you are not even sure if they die, they just disappear like they never existed.  There are also many aspect of this game that are simply broken, for example every time you want to pick something up, open a door or interact with anything you must pause near the object for a moment before hitting the \"x\" button or your character will jump like an idiot and waste a second of your life.   Most of the side quest in the game are boring and repetitive fetch quests.  The combat system is basically Dynasty Warriors with a counter option that only works 50% of the time.  Magic hurts allies and enemies equally and has to be manually setup repeatedly so its more of a pain than a benefit.

Therefore, the 2nd half may not be as good as the first game in my view; however, to my knowledge the biggest flaw with the 2nd half is it's more on the rails without the open world aspect. That said, the open world is so diverse and fun, then the only issue is you may not be able to explore it much during certain story aspects. Nothing wrong with it, but handcuffs at times is a little annoying, and the only flaw that bothers me. The other flaw is the story/lore for the fact you need to go outside the game to know it all. In fact, the main story is the prince and his 3 friends traveling around during a crisis, and slowly built up your powers.

I went in to 15 with low expectations, especially with it quartet of kpop boyband idols, I came out shocked. I found myself lost exploring the beautiful open world taking on dozens of side quests for hours without touching the story.

At first the sheer scale of the game had taken my breath away, and with out any major development I became quickly attached to the characters. The battle system took me some getting use to at first. I wanted to treat it like a hack and slash style game, and not the Diablo esq hold down the button game it is. I am saddened that magic doesn't play as big of a role in this game, but the combat system is fun and makes up for the lack of magic. I hope to see magic get a better role in XVI. The story presentation is well done IMO, and allows you to take breaks when you see fit like older FF games. My only complaint so far is that trying to venture out into the world at night when your still in early game is a near death sentence because most of the monsters will vastly outclass you.

Thankfully on the moment to moment basis XV will make you forget the sour taste XIII left us. Give it a chance, this is FINALLY the right direction for final fantasy. Don\u00b4t believe the trolls that rather have a bad game that to admit this one is really good."], ["SnurgBurgler", "User", "10", "I just can't even put into words how much I love this game. From the story, to the characters, to everything, this game is just amazing. The characters are amazing. I was a bit worried as I thought that Noctis was going to be a selfish brat, Prompto was going to be an annoying one-liner, Ignis was going to be a pompous self-centered jerk, and that Gladio was going to be a meathead, but boy was I wrong. I should have known they were going to be amazing considering that Tetsuya Nomura (from Kingdom Hearts) was going to be working on character design, but I was still worried. As I said, I was dead wrong, the characters are amazing with a different personality to each of them and they just all meld together perfectly. I actually care about the characters, and they're some of the most memorable characters I've ever experienced in any game. You can feel the brotherhood and bond that they share, whether through their actions or their dialogue. The dialogue is amazing and natural, it never felt stale or pushed. When running around the world, I feel like I'm actually talking to a friend in real life. Another thing that helps with this is the stellar voice acting. Final Fantasy games are not the most well known for their voice acting (example: Titus laugh in Final Fantasy X), but the voice acting in this game is amazing. When I looked at the IMDB page for this game, I didn't know any of the voice actors, but they surprised me as they just feel so real. Their emotions are greatly conveyed through the tone in their voice and I hope that these people pop up more often in the games industry as I love them in this game. Speaking of audio, the soundtrack is fantastic. I mean, I was expecting it to be fantastic, but it really is. Every song I loved and every song I found memorable. Another great thing is that you can listen to the soundtracks for all of the past Final Fantasy games in the car or out in the world (once you've acquired the MP3 player). The presentation is amazing as the world is beautiful and full of different environments. How they managed to make the game look so beautiful but keep a pretty solid 30fps is beyond me, but if this is the engine that they're using for FFVII Remastered, then I have high hopes for that game as this runs amazing (keep in mind I'm using the base PS4). That's also while running the individual physics on the character's hair and clothes, on the flora and fauna, so it really is impressive. Texture pop-in is very minimal which is great since it keeps you into the game and immersed. Now, that doesn't mean there isn't pop-in or weird looking textures, after all, this is an open-world game. There's bound to be bugs and glitches, but for the most part I haven't encountered many that are to make note of. The open-world is vast and has many things to do. Now, the game does get more linear towards the end, but it makes sense as it has to wrap up the storyline. Some sidequests may get repetitive at times, but for the most part they're different in their own right. You get to meet some very interesting and fun characters which is also a plus. There's missions where you take pictures, missions where you hunt down beasts, or missions where you find ores to bring back to a specific person. Each character also has specific skills. Noctis likes fishing, Ignis likes cooking, Prompto likes taking pictures, and Gladio's is survival (leveled up by just walking around). The story is great, and I'm not going to spoil it for you, but it is a very good story. Now last, but certainly not least, the new combat system. The new combat system is refined, ditching the turn based combat and going for a more real-time combat. People will have their opinions about it, but I absolutely love it and if you're a fan of the combat in Kingdom Hearts, it's a lot like that. If you want a more turned bast strategy feel, you can turn on wait mode which when you aren't moving, the game will pause and allow you to plan your attacks. Overall, this game is amazing. Everything it does, it does right. It took a lot of chances that ended up paying off in the end, and I absolutely adore this game. The story can get a bit iffy at times, but for the most part is solid, especially if you decide to watch the movie and the anime, though if you don't do that you should still be fine. The polish of the game is also amazing as well as everything feels solid.

I'm 30 years old and have been gaming almost all my life, so how I made it through all this time without playing one is beyond me.  Anyway, FF 15 feels to me like a much more streamlined RPG with what feels like more of a western RPG than a JRPG.  You are set in a gigantic open world (I would argue that it is almost as big as The Witcher 3) with 3 bros' and a really nice car.  From what I understand FF was always turn based combat whereas 15 is not.  I'm not going to say the combat is perfect but it is almost there.  The camera can get real frustrating, and if you play I would suggest using the far camera setting when out in the open and middles when indoors, and turning wait mode on.  Wait mode pretty much pauses the game when Noctis (your character) stops moving.  It gives you more opportunity to plan and execute more.  Those things together make combat a lot more fun imo..  This might sound stupid but the combat feels a lot like the Arkham games.  Where you are holding down circle to attack and sometimes hitting square when prompted to block (on ps4 anyway).  It just isn't quite as polished as the arkham games but it works just fine.  Being a newcomer to the series I know **** about what is actually going on in the story so I would assume if you haven't played any, or at least in a while you wont either.  But that is ok.  The gameplay was enough to keep me hooked.   I really like the friends you travel with.  Ignus, Gladiolus, and Prompto are your travel companions through most of the game and I gotta say it was a lot of fun having them around.  The banter was sometimes actually funny and it was cool seeing them bonding.  It gave me a family vibe that was really interesting and fun to witness.

But that does not mean that i do not feel let down, because i do. The story is disjointed and full of holes. many important characters are only given screentime for about 3 seconds...there is a severe lack of cutscenes and no amount of decent cinematography. Everything we ever saw in any of the trailers are false. what i mean by that is, nothing that we see in those clips ever appear in the game. so i was waiting for things to happen that i had seen, to no avail. that is very good marketing yes, but it is also false marketing. So i naturally feel let down. also, there are 4 summons. you cannot control when they appear, which is actually kind of cool, because it works, it makes every appearance all the more special, but there are only 4...you get another legendary summon which makes 5, but it only appears during an obligatory cutscene. summons have always been one of the greatest and breathtaking aspects of the series, and to see it reduced to almost nothing is sad. though i have to say, those few that do appear in the game, are beyond awesome. absolutely gorgeous! so all is probably good. i just wish they had spent less time making a huge CGI action film with AAA names attatched to it, 2 independent games for android, a 5 episode animation series and a bunch of other crap in order to tell more of the worlds story...damnit, tell the damn story in the god damn game! at the beginning of the announcements last year, when we learned that all of these meta things were incoming, i screamed like a little girl who had just touched a hot stove! But it was only later that i realized that they obviously had to take away from the actualy game in order to make all of this other crap. so no, i do not condone this kind of meta philosophy. they should have cut the movie, cut the two android games, justice monsters five and kings knight, and the anime series and all the other **** and just focus all of their attention on the only thing that actually mattered in the first place. the god. damned. GAME. YES, i do love it, but i do feel betrayed, to an extent. the game feels unfinished, not so much in terms of mechanics, but in terms of interesting quests and storytelling and involvement of character. i understand why they may have made some different choices, and i am all for that evolution of the series, but i am NOT for the sacrifice of time spent on making the actualy product in order to make a bunch of lesser products to accompany the main product. obviously that obstructs resources and time that should have been focused into the main game and only the game. but it is still breathtakingly beautifully made. the combat is super fun, the music is powerful and there are a lot of good things to experience."], ["VisualKnight", "User", "9", "So I haven't played a Final Fantasy that had you really \"care\" about the Characters since Final Fantasy VIII.

In fact, I started this franchise not so long ago. First played VII then X and then VI. I have loved all of those. I went to play this game because of hype. Everybody was playing so I figured out, well it must be good so let's give it a shot. After roughly 30 hours more or less, I can give an honest opinion. Graphics: generally fine, cutscenes are pristine,  facial animations are out of sync and outdated. Gameplay: probably the biggest change and it is kind of a mess. There is so much going on on the screen that it feels convoluted. And the matter of fact that you can only control Noctis, gives the other teammates less value compared to when other FF games encouraged you to use them too. Gameplay has two or three good, relatively epic parts but that's it. Music: not bad. Story: now this is where things go really wrong. The game starts simple enough and as you progress, things start to get more complicated. I can tell you that story wise, the game starts solid enough but it just can't keep up later on. Character development is dumbed down to the point where I did not cared at all about any of them, even in the pointless offscreen deaths. The story has some good parts like any game but it falls heavily short compared to other FF games. The final aspect that really makes this game suffer are the quests. RPG games need good quests. Quests that have depth and sense. Most of the quests here are given only by a handful of characters and basically consist of fetching stuff. Quests are very very repetitive and have no sense of value. If I did them, it was only to grind some exp. points out. A good RPG game needs a solid story and great quests.

The main 4 are fine and are quite possibly some of my favorite in the franchise. The side characters however are hardly there. Even characters like Luna and Cor, two heavily advertised characters are hardly there. It doesn't give us any time to get attached or to even get to know anyone outside of the main 4. The Altissia segment i think highlights all of this the best. You do 2 short quests, meat 2 new characters that you  never see again and you're done. This being said not everything about it was bad. I think if it was just better paced and told it would have been absolutely fantastic. As i said the main 4 are great, there's a very real sense of comradery between them that i've never seen in a final fantasy or even most games before.

Like 2015's MGS V (a phenomenal title) FFXV has a noticeably 'patch-work' storyline which can be very jarring at times, as whole segments are skipped over or diluted in some way. Moreover, the transition from open-world to linearity, by the end of the game, is slightly disappointing as (following from chapter 8) many areas that could've been opened up to free exploration, were relegated to a 'corridor-esque' experience (especially chapter 13, a significant low point during the course of the plot). A few other negatives would include: the majority of sidequests being bland, uninteresting, and uninspired fetchquests; the villain (although intriguing and enigmatic-if somewhat obvious-at first) being made a typical, maniacal bad-guy;  and issue of the camera being hard to negotiate whilst in combat (especially in tight spaces, such as dungeons)."], ["djangojazz", "User", "8", "So basically the graphics are top notch and the combat is very well done.  In fact I liked the combat system so much that I don't get why others gripe.  You basically are combing an adventure game with role playing in that you move real time and do things like an action game, but you still have magic, abilities and a strategy to how to do things.   You can update your abilities as you progress and need to think with certain enemies how to beat them.  It is not button mashing but tweaking abilities.  I really liked the world and traveling around.  Now for the bad...  There are ridiculous amounts of times you get caught up by an inch high cliff and the surrounding where you cannot get through something or you cannot see something.  The other issue is how SLOW you drive.  I mean you have a car that looks like a Bugatti that is almost a character in and of itself and yet it goes 55 everywhere?  Lame.  That and a lot of 'loading....' were a reason I did not like this game enough to dock it two grades.  It seemed well worth the weight in depth, what you could do, exploration, difficulty keeping you entertained.  But the loading and bad getting stuck was lame at times.  But maybe on the PC it loads faster, on the PS4 it was slow at times.  Near playing 30 plus hours on it I was starting to be like: \"Come on load!\" when doing fast traveling.  Overall the game is worth playing and the good story, good characters and actual fun of fighting enemies makes it feel like a return to form.  I would not rate it as high as FF7, FF8, FF6, or FF12 but it definitely is light years better than FF13 and I would say it is in the middle of the pack overall of FF games for fun."], ["AstralMirage", "User", "8", "I'm going to make this a short intro.

So much care was given to making this a truly immersive experience. It's unfortunate that some stilted design choices ripped me clear out of the finely crafted experience. Namely, the quirks of the second half left me speechlessly baffled as the game went from totally open world to FFXIII level linear without communicating this to the player. It wouldn't be an issue if that wasn't, literally, the rest of the game and doesn't stop until you fully complete the story. Not a design choice I object to, just one that left me trying to beat my way through it so I could get back to the open world again not knowing I could go back at multiple points. Little did I know that that was what Umbra was for. The time travelling umbra mechanic was so poorly explained that it left me utterly confused as I hacked my way through increasingly frustrating sections where my character became more and more under leveled with each passing minute. This got so bad in fact that I got stranded in the second half while under leveled and wasn't near somewhere to call umbra. This led to a very, VERY tough boss battle that I had to beat while under leveled and under gunned. All of this tainted my first experience of what is, otherwise a very well crafted story. For how amazing everything else is in this game, the lack of a proper explanation of how to manage the second half of the game seems downright amateurish. Overall though, if that aspect were better explained to allow better flow to the narrative, this experience would still be one of the most cinematic and highly polished experiences in recent memory.

The saddest part of this game is knowing what it could have been given the time it deserved. Every aspect of this game is beautiful yet unfinished. You are continually led along intricately detailed pathways that lead to dead ends or seem to head in one direction before awkwardly diverting down a different and underwhelming route. You can literally see the seams where portions of the game were cut apart and pasted together to make a 2016 release deadline, and its sad, because you are continuously aware of the team's hope for there to have been so much more. The most noticeable seams being where they hacked apart the narrative leaving a story both incomplete and unintelligible. Despite this, the core characters are reasonably well written and it is their journey that keeps this hodgepodge collage of a video game glued together in a way that amazingly still works so well. Positives for me: Cooking, Camping/Hotels/, Monsters/Bosses, Photography, Dungeons,  World Design. Let Downs: All villains besides Ardyn, npc design/animation and general programming/ All characters besides main four are ankle deep or shallower, cities are barely explorable, Side quests are repetitive and poorly written.

You are forced to repel down rock walls, that look so sloped you could easily walk up them... You can also get stuck on logs/rocks.  3)The story \u2014 Oh boy...

As you navigate throughout the semi-open world, and I use that term loosely, I will get frequent drops in frame rate.  1080p, yes, 60fps, no.  With the power of the PlayStation 4 being strong enough to handle graphically intensive games like GTA5 or The Witcher 3, I have a hard time believing that Firewatch is more intensive than those.  The lack of achievement is another thing that turns me off with this game.  There is an absence of motivation to replay this game when you're not being rewarded for making a different choice.  To spend another three and a half hours playing it just to possibly get a different outcome is not appealing to me when I don't receive a trophy for my time well spent.

The voice acting is top-notch, and you really do feel like the two main characters forge a relationship of sorts, even though you're mainly talking to each other over the walkie-talky.

Instead of slow gameplay based on exploration which I was hoping to see, developers gave us an adult and serious story (yeah!) and set it in high tension atmosphere.

I wouldn't say this game is like dark souls, but if you get angry at that game, you'll probably get mad while playing For Honor. There's a steep learning curve but once you get it,  you'll be executing Knights, Vikings, and Samurai with ease. There's lots of videos on combat and on the basic and advanced moves for each character. I'd recommend playing everyone at least once, and then choosing your favorite to focus on and level up. It's also beneficial to practice blocking and attacking if you have a friend in custom match. You can change the settings so that you both receive ieve less damage so that you can practice longer without dying. Also save your steel on scavenging gear till you at least get to Reputation 1. The rarity of the items you get from the chest depends on each characters level so buying them early for level 1 gear is just a waste. Story mode isn't very deep but can be a fun break from multiplayer. It can be coop as well so you can play with a friend. There are some issues with the game though, which are the currency and connection. Currency in the form of Steel can be bought with with real money which then can be used to buy a range of things, but the main issues come from maxing out your characters feats with some steel and things that give an extreme unfair advantage. For the connection issues, I would say if you ever played Rainbow 6 Siege then you'll be used to connection problems. Sometimes you'll connect to a game within 30 seconds, others times minutes will go by without a single teammate. Perhaps this will get better in time, but when the game does connect it's very fun. Although people will complain that enemies will run away instead of fighting to the death when their losing, that's just part of warfare. That's a strategy you should be aware of that they might use, and should try to corner them into a wall to cut off their escape. There's a counter to everything in this game if you just have the patience to learn it. If you enjoy highly skill and competitive based game, that takes a little bit of work to get, but has a high payout then I'd highly recommend For Honor."], ["powL", "User", "9", "Pretty good game!

Do you like fighting games? If Yes- Buy this you will get the most out of it all the classes are fun and unique each one is literally like a different character and you can spend forever learning tips and tactics with each, If you dont like fighting games, it may still be for you but be wary, from what i can tell, at the moment the games features might be lacking a bit, and while the setting and atmosphere may carry you, this is STILL essentially a fighting game at its core and you have to spend time to learn it, rather than go in and get pissed off when people who know how to play fighting games kill you again and again, you cant mash your way though it online, you have to think and be clever, on the good side though, its not remarkably complicated, its very simple in fact so spend the couple of hours to learn how to do things like safely approach and parry, and properly defend and punish and this game could teach you the fundamentals of any fighting game.... In conclusion i feel like this game suffers maybe from the Street Fighter V problem (though nowhere near as severe) where, Combat... 10/10, Setting/Atmosphere/Graphics 10/10, Features.... probably more around a 5/10 (street fighter v would have been a 2/10)... Its a superb game, i already know it is, but if you're looking for the single player experience, dont bother, looking for great online play thats nothing like anything else on the market... buy now, or maybe wait a bit for a price drop or a nice meaty update that perhaps adds something special... i dont feel like i can give a score because i dont own the full game but just considering its something new and exiting the devs alone need something in the green for branching out and making something DIFFERENT"], ["VitaminK", "User", "0", "Not the game we were promised.

The single player is short but I didn't think I should look at it negatively since anyone who is interested in the game should be looking solely at the multiplayer.  Rather the single player is an extended tutorial before you dive into the multiplayer. For Honor is at its heart a fighting game and people who aren't into fighting games this one won't change your mind. 1v1 is the most balanced of the game modes in multiplayer then it begins to fall off. All the classes are distinct and balanced. I love the feeling that the characters and weapons have weight and momentum, and the gameplay is easy to pick up but very hard to master. P2P game hosting is not ideal, if the host drops you're pretty much paused until a new host can be established. This is my biggest complaint about the game.

You're screwed with the aiming if your too far away, and smg's do nothing. Matches are much shorter than i thought, I thought they'd go on for hours but still, it's Caspian border sprinting over grassy hills times 10. When you're parachuting out the bus, with a dopey lame character rarely seen in games, you'll wonder(yes I'm borrowing this from that, Medal of Honor review) no, you'll realize your wasting your time on a level that hasn't been seen since a long, long, longer, time ago. Solo is the only way to maybe have one worthwhile kill, making you instered enough in the outcome, and I've seen some amazing battles that haven't been seen before in games. I'm proud of epic for turning their, company failure level flop, into something that is almost bigger than gears. But they sure did it in a shameless way. Shouldn't we rely on the makers that brought us the ultimate stuff to make the next evolution? In this case no. Why should we make a fuss about yet another post ME3 crate game(ok, 40 hours is evil) when we're seeing worse things, like the whole cosmetic items pull that is now on a much larger scale? Smashing jiggly bricks is a new mechanic that's on the level of some top shooting feedback. However, we're taught that fun but tedious moves give us xp or even small font size white text. Instead we really get nothing but having a supply of wood that will ether lead to a awsome new player created move of circle building\", as i just made up(the name at least) or a control mishap of selecting the weapon you want but never get in time, or get hit the last fateful times when it's constructing in front of you. So all that(and when your in a squad they break brick for minutes at a time, in games, time is hyper useful) will probably lead to nothing. I love seeing the pro's (i,e the girl that killed you or the top 10, not some stupid e sporter or youtuber, ugh) use the build and shoot to masterfully show their personality though predetermined animations. It's like the final guy in search and destroy who place two claymores and do the yy tap thing after a kill. Quick building for cover while running away was something that showed me game mechanics can go farther and work. I don't like paragraphs. The little but important snap of seeing new animations, sounds, or textures is something that I've never seen before. Updating does show that we're getting the stick for playing a very early and reactive game. It depends how far it goes. If we see something totally superior to what we slogged through than I'll feel even more like that nearly 30 hours(wait, seriously, yeah i think it was like 20 something, that's absolutely ridiculous) was soul killing. But their also will be a little of I was important and the feeling of seeing a process never done by consoles and big names. Ever since skyrim and next gen, we've seen the focus go to a great wealth of content that just wouldn't  have done before, but if you think about it, they definelty could have done way more worthwhile and not time disrespecting(think Gt freakin A, I did it cause there was nothing else and I always complete baby) content that might've made this incredibly disappointing half generation(I was really too idealistic) be composed of memorable moments(I can't think of any other way to put those last two words, thank years of reading game critics) The art style initially came off a far too juvenile and it still could be a lot more intuned with surperior game styles but I love the beauty isolation feeling of the island that I compare both to game and show form of the walking dead. The purple pink sky with wispy clouds and new stars sold me to it. And while most of the characters are incredibly generic and conform to the style that games are so good at becoming their own from, I still adore the back camera following view of dark ponytail girl. It's almost always worth it with her. The new social dynamic of BR with squads makes me just want to talk to people in my own, won't see them after match, so be a different cool version of yourself way(think trying to sound like tracer, it kinda works?) But when you find some new acquaintances  that join your party slate, Joking around and calling out targets and feeling the panic of getting absolutely Flanked far overcedes the actual game. Kills or time in doesn't even matter anymore. But that leads to the main mind hitter(I'm trying to not sound like Everybody), starting matches just to find someone with a mike, and if they do, finding out their a disappointing, It's cool dude, it's chill(i.e the majority?) guy is a lot worse than you could have been doing"], ["ZeoN", "User", "7", "Bastante similar al PUBG pero algo mas incompleto y peor hecho tecnicamente.Recomendable para pasar un buen rato con tus amigos y sentir emociones fuertes en un juego survival de disparos"], ["Lyvins", "User", "8", "First of all the game as of now is free to play ... the Battle Royal is amazing and you don't have to spend a penny.

Any thoughts of having a game similar to State of Decay, 7 Days to Die, or even Minecraft are not going to happen. How this game works is that you play missions with your friends. These missions are for the most part the same (go to/find a point or person, turn it on/speak to them, defend point/person for 2 waves of enemies, victory.) The game is built around a free to play model, which means there are going to be getting numerous loot boxes filled with obscure BS that will not aid you in the slightest. Ammo and resources carry over to other missions so having supplies to build forts and defenses are never a problem, which is a plus. The issue is that the resources for bullets are not in every map, which means in some cases if you run out of ammo, you will not get any new ammo for the remainder of the mission, sometimes even the next few missions. The game is pretty and can be fun with friends, however the fun itself is not created by the game, but rather the friends. Because of its rather shallow mission variations, the game gets old very quickly and can lose luster almost immediately. The game does have some pretty detailed skill and research trees though. Customization is also pretty deep in the game, as skins for characters do in fact change the load out abilities and stats of the characters on top of the starting stats from the different characters. This added with the use of class creation by using survivors you have (who all have different bonuses to add) to create a customized class bonus, on top of the skill and research tree means that almost every character will be different.

The gameplay is fast and the combat is still entertaining 40+ hours on. Personally, I find this game to be a perfect mix of elements with pick up groups usually yielding good results. Sometimes you will get players who are farming while you are are trying to complete a mission but many missions can be completed by 2-3 competent people (or if you level up your squad a bit first).

I found the game design to be excellent. You fight many bosses, each with their own unique attacks which forces you to adapt. The trick to defeating the bosses is LEARNING THEM and PRACTICE. After a good few tries you will have memorised their attacks and will know at what points to attack, giving you the knowledge and power to defeat them. Each boss has many different phases with each presenting a new challenge and once you master even just a single phase you feel incredibly powerful. I also felt the hardest difficulty, 'Furier' was well designed as instead of just giving the enemy more health and you less which would of been pretty cheap and unfair, the game actually changes the boss's attacks, giving new projectiles you have to dodge, faster melee attacks and and quicker reaction times therefore making you remaster each boss all over again.

There are certainly parts of the main game that would give off that impression (For me only two in particular. You'll know the ones I'm talking about.), but if you have the patience and dedication, you WILL get it down. It may seem tedious to play back up to where you were defeated, but the more you die at that part, the better you get at the rest of the boss fight leading up to it, which is very satisfying.  And extremely satisfying when you finally nail that part that's giving you trouble. But again, if you do not enjoy the experience of learning and getting a boss fight down, you will not like this game. Because that's what it is. Aside from scenic walking sections from boss to boss that progress the narrative, this game is purely boss fights. And given that it's only boss fights, they're long, challenging, and will take you a while. But each boss is unique and challenging in a different way. No two bosses, or areas you fight them in are similar to another. Each is an experience. And that's what makes this game great in my eyes. But again, if you don't find that type of game as satisfying as I do, you won't like this game. Story wise, there's so cool things that are done. But the story is told in a way that slowly clues you into what's going on, and only really gives you an explanation once you beat the game. So if story would be some sort of redemption for you, keep in mind that story is your reward for completing these challenging fights, which I find fantastic, but might not sit well with others."], ["TheLewdOne", "User", "9", "A really fun game if you like a challenge, dislike handholding and hack n' slash meets bullethell gameplay. Lots of room for improvement through a fast paced combat system, speedrun mode and challenges and no hit challenges are all things that greatly add to my enjoyment of this game. The story is both pretty abstract but also fairly clear by the end which was a nice touch I wasn't expecting, most indie games with abstract story tend to try to keep it abstract so people keep talking about it but Furi actually does a decent job of answering most questions the player asks while going from boss to boss."], ["stamito", "User", "9", "I like it when we get games like this in PS plus, it is a good way of discovering great games that otherwise we wouldn\u2019t buy, or that\u2019s the way I want to see it."], ["KayVen17", "User", "7", "Deutsche Review - Kritik"], ["ShadowX", "User", "9", "Furi is an entertaining game that puts you right in the action, it features complete One on One combat with powerful individuals, in some cases, you may become frustrated, but the amazing diversified score composed for the game as well as the fluid combat keeps you in, the story of the game is mostly symbolic, and the lore behind the characters is not explained in detail, but it was still entertaining to beat this game in one sitting."], ["HTGamer", "User", "8", "Furi is a rough gem."], ["Handsome_Jack", "User", "9", "This game is simple but amazing. The idea of the the style is eye numbing and hectic which is beautifully followed by the soundtrack that brings a very nice techno sound to a very techno art style. The difficulty is actually hard (for me at least) and gives the feeling of an accomplishment when you beat one of the bosses. The simple control add to the brilliance of the combat in the way that only you are to blame for failure. The bullet hell segments were a nice change of pace along with the close quarter segments.
