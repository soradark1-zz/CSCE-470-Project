But after playing 3 days fully..... it has disappointed me far worse than I could have imagined. The game itself renders the cinematic movies beautifully. It truly feels like you are taking part in some of the classics that I have grown up on. But the sluggish controls really hamper the game. Using the shoulder buttons to turn your monster is not that bad once you get used to it..... but it becomes chaotic when you are suddenly forced to slowly turn around and try to face what is attacking you from behind.  The recovery time from being attacked is also really slow as it seems some monsters can just hit you over and over and over again without pause, all the while you are still trying to correct your position just so you may have a fighting chance. Most times, it ends in a premature death. Especially when fighting against the computer on Hard. Its almost impossible when Mothra is continuously spiraling at you and all you can do is take the hit. The addition of a block button would have been nice, but seeing how there isn't one, it just feels cheap. I really like the graphics myself. It has a nostalgia to it that makes it feel like you are in the movie or playing a part of it . As opposed to other Godzilla games, these are the best graphics the monster has received in some while. The addition of online play is a hit or miss. Sometimes it is absolute fun (minus the awkward controls) but most times there seems to be a lag that really hinders the experience. There is a real lack of game modes and it just gets so repetitive to play the same modes repeatedly just to unlock and level up monsters. I had to play all monsters doing the same mission over and over again just to reach a certain height / unlock new abilities. Its unfortunate as I have loved all the Godzilla games I have ever played. Save The Earth, Unleashed, Destroy All Monsters Melee, but this is the worst of the bunch. It pains me because I am a HUGE Godzilla fan and have been since my boyhood years. I just wish that somehow someone could get it right. But this is not the one. I would only recommend renting this game first before you shell out $60  for it. The lack of game play modes, repetitive play, poor controls and awful online functionality make this a bigger disaster than even Godzilla himself could make. I just hope that one day we get another game that will do him justice. Online could be great, but with sluggish controls and a lag that's almost consistent throughout....its a monster disappointment . ;("], ["DSX714", "User", "5", "It's not as bad as people are making out to be. Is it worth $60? Definitely not. Try $20 at the most. The Graphics aren't as bad as people say, They're pretty average not awful just not something that stands out. Is it repetitive? Yes but oddly less repetitive than recent Dynasty Warriors games. Is the acting terrible? No, not really. People say it's laughable and cheesy but all I hear is average acting that gets the job done. Is the fighting well done? Eh, the fighting is pretty meh. What makes matters worse is there's little use of blocking or dodging and that everything you do in single player modes carries over to online which makes the game void of traditional fighting and more of a contest on who has the strongest monster and not who IS the strongest monster. Speaking of online there is no offline versus mode which means no COM or Local Multiplayer like Godzilla games such as Destroy all monsters melee. Are the controls that bad? Actually, no. The controls work for a Godzilla game the only big problem is that you turn with L1 and R1 which can get annoying and sometimes even get you stuck being hit from behind by other monsters becoming very cheap, very fast. Overall, it's mildy interesting for Godzilla fans but that's about it. It's not as bad as people make it out to be but that doesn't mean it's good.

The models of the monsters are amazing and look just like the props used in the godzilla franchise, the controls are very different from most games as you the l and r 1 buttons to steer your monster.

Personally i love the monster roster as it has a nice pick of every series of godzilla movies, such as hedorah, king ghidorah, rodan and amazingly the legendary pictures version of godzilla. The best part of this game HAS to be the multiplayer as you smack down other players from across the world. Each monster can be uprgraded when you defeat them in the main campaign and the nods to the series are so awesome, such as jet jaguar shrinking, godzilla flying, and mecha godzillas forcefield.

Another point is the lack of cars, which again is compared to older installments that had a list of 1000+ cars, while also knowing that they scrapped most of the models and started from scratch (building some of the most detailed models I've seen in any game) which was also known from early on during the development cycle.

The cars have more weight and grip to them, its no longer as easy to throw a car into a corner like GT6 and expect to come out the other side still doing 120mph, you really need to break early and catch the curb perfectly to get the best out of each car, each cars characteristics are very well implemented and the cars feel alive. The Sound Department has had a major upgrade and each car sounds as they should, backfire,gear whine and chasis judder are just some of the sound effects that are present, tire squeel has been updated, sounds much more realistic and quieter as it should. Graphically GTS has the best lighting engine of any console racer to date, its simply stunning, especially with dynamic 4k HDR on the PS4 Pro, PD spent 4 years working on HDR and it shows as its the best representation of HDR so far this gen. GTS features a non traditional campaign instead focusing on teaching people how to drive, race etiquette and mission challenges which can require you to pass as many cars as possible before the time runs out or simply knock down all the cones on   track. the car rewards alone are enough to encourage you to get gold in all of them, top it of with Lewis Hamilton as your racing guide to show you the fastest way around the Green Hell and the package really starts to come together. For people who enjoyed the online lobby racing in GT6 fear not as GTSports has this same lobby system but much much better, you literally have a tone of features to set up your dream races with friends and is very easy to navigate through the menus and settings.Sport mode is were players will compete in Esports competitions in conjunction with the FIA with the goal of attaining a real world racing license. All the tutorials that you will play through in campaign are designed to help you be a better racing driver in Sports mode.

This is in stark contrast to my experience of the final revision of GT6, which was my first racing sim. GT Sport leaves the distinct impression of a job that was left to the last minute to finish, or wherein the workload was vastly underestimated. As I live in a country where a 220ms latency to GT servers is an issue, though I drive online competitions from time to time I much prefer a good career mode experience. In this respect whilst the AI competitors aren't bad, the fundamental construction of the career mode is uninspiring. Added to that a limited track- and car variety makes for a game which gets old very soon. Due to the lack of variety the daily reward for driving 42km a day more often than not results in being rewarded with the same gift car over and over again. In the absence of vehicle variety why could they not have provided a choice of either gift car or game credits for future use? The game lacks the facility to test-drive vehicles on tracks of your choice on your own time and the vehicle performance upgrades are a dismal shadow of what was available in GT6 where you had a choice of different exhaust systems, ECU's, stage 1-3 engine tuning, turbo- or super chargers, catalytic converters, to name but a few. Apparently the latter was done due to the perception that the later generation of racers are less technically inclined. I cannot disagree more as I perceive the opposite to be true! Car enthusiasm is not a sport for the technically disinclined! Though I cannot talk from first hand experience, media literature seems to suggest that GT5 & GT6 were also initially launched in highly unfinished states with significant user criticism. This seems to be true for GT Sport as well. I take note that a tremendous amount of work has gone into this game thus far, and as an engineer I truly respect that.

But why is there no real single player content? Only driving school \"tutorial\" missions is a bad joke. And why only 13 tracks and only 50 cars (with variations 160 cars)? No dynamic weather conditions, nor any weather conditions at all! Why? The community out cry is well deserved. Please release free DLCs to add more tracks, cars and single player content (an offline playable singleplayer campaign)!! Have a look how well Driveclub got polished after the rocky launch, it got masses of free DLCs, dynamic weather conditions, an bike addon. You can do better. At the moment GT Sport can be called \"Gran Turismo 7 Prologue\" due it's missing content (singleplayer, cars, tracks, fun)  :("], ["Jagkings5", "User", "8", "Gran Turismo Sport is a great game.

I have enjoyed what i have played so far of the Main story but switching between the characters interrupts the story and makes it less interesting and enjoyable to me especially when it forces me to play as characters I have no interest in to progress further in the story.  To be completely honest though the reason I gave this a bad review is almost entirely the online multiplayer aspect of the game.  GTA 5's Online game play is a joke when it even works!  Trying to play with an open server i suffered through constant network errors and disconnects until finally getting it to work somewhat reliably in a private game with some friends.   GTA V online is purely designed as a cheap cash grab gimmick.   it lets you steal and test drive any available car in the game but if you want to permanently own most of the nicer more expensive cars you have to spend large sums of in game money to purchase them from a web app on your in game phone.  In order to make the money you can do in game missions which take you to separate instances away from the main online server OR you can spend real money to buy in game cash.  If you find a really nice car you like driving and you load into a mission instance the car disappears and you have to go find it again elsewhere which i suspect is an intentional aspect of the game to trick people into spending more real money so they can keep the car without loosing it.  If you think about it the sole purpose of the missions is to grind for money so that you can buy  the cars in the game so spending real money to buy the cars defeats the purpose of playing the online multiplayer at all.  The missions instances employ unnecessary and annoying loading screens and menu navigation.  The last GTA game i played and enjoyed was San Andreas where you could do missions like Vigilante by just hopping in a police car and then driving around chasing down criminals.  I loved that, not this mission hub garbage.  In the 4-5 hour span of time i played i only tried one race mission but it didn't let me use my car, instead it forced me to use a preselected car for the race / track that was the same care the other people racing with me had to use.

Well, the whole thing is sharper, crisper, more vibrant with more detail. The first thing i noticed was how much sharper and crisper it is compared to last gen. The 1080p resolution makes a noticeable difference on its own. The jaggie edges etc from last gen have gone and everything looks crisp and clear. Then i noticed how much more vibrant it is compared to last gen. The colours pop more and the lighting effects are way better. The next thing i noticed was the level of detail has increased. Its lots of small details that add up to a big change. For instance. The cars are now shiny and reflect light. They are also more detailed. You can see more detail in break lights and such. Even chrome wheels look chrome and reflect light. Road surfaces etc have more detail in the way of cracks, moss, dirt etc. Its all had a texture bump to look more realistic. There is now more litter laying and even blowing around the game world. Plastic bags and things blow around. There is also bits of foliage and other debris blowing around all the time. It makes the whole game world feel more alive. The foliage system has been increased dramatically right across the game world. There are now more trees, flowers, grass and such. Some of the trees and foliage is the same as previous gen but with bumped up textures, but then there are a lot of new trees and foliage too. It looks great. Water has had a texture increase and now seems to be a bit more erratic in places. The waves seem more wild and the crash and splash against rocks is now more so. The rain effects have seen quite a drastic change. It looks much more realistic and even floods the game world by leaving puddles all over. And thanks to the new lighting system, lights, fire etc cast reflections in the puddles and ocean. You can even see rain droplets in the ocean. It looks very impressive and is probably the most drastic change of all.  There are now more cars than ever before. Even cars from previous GTAIV and Episodes From Liberty City have been added, plus lots of new ones. The traffic has also been increased, but not so much it makes it difficult to get around. Its just about right. There is now an in car view too. Each car has its own in car dashboard view and interior. Some have gages, and some have digitial gages. It even shows the radio station and the name of the song that you are listening to on the radio. They even light up. It all looks great, but  just don't expect the same level of detail as say Forza or Project Gotham Racing. You can see gages, lights, text on the radio, leather effect seats etc in clear detail though. There is also a first person view which makes it a whole different game. You can aim down the sites of your guns in different ways, roll, cover, everything. It makes for a new GTA experience. Personally i only really use the first person mode while driving and stay in 3rd person when out of the car. But you can do as you please. So its nice to have all the extra options. Character models, especially the main characters, all have a new level of detail and look even better than before. You can see scars, hairs, pigmentation and wrinkles in the skin. It makes them feel more alive. There are also more animals and insects than before. From cats, dolphins, moths, killer whales, hammer head sharks and more. Even older animals like  dogs have been increased. Pedestrian numbers have also been increased. There are now more with more variety. AI of pedestrians has been increased too. They will try and steal your car and all sorts. Sounds have also seen a big increase and make the whole thing feel more alive and realistic. And 100 more songs have been added, as has new radio chatter. Damage to cars has also been upgraded a bit.  I'm sure there is more that i've missed.  The only problem i have with this game is that the story and missions are the worst in the GTA franchise. As a technical achievement it is a 10/10.

The game has so much things to do. The story is very entertaining all most of the time. The times that i found boring were mostly Trevor missions, i personally found them uninteresting compared to Franklin's missions and Michael's missions. Personally i find Franklin to be my favorite character. Even though the characters are meant to be dislikable to a degree, i find Franklin to be more of a character that I enjoy. The side characters that you will meet throughout your journey are also very interesting and i tended to spend a lot of time learning more about them. The gunfights are great in the game. The driving mechanics are some of the best in gaming and there is so much to do. This game is worth full price any day. I don't think it is worth it if you just care about the multiplayer, the multiplayer is honestly the weakest part of the game and i tend to spend most of my time in the singleplayer. The improvements from the ps3 to the ps4 are quite remarkable. The game is beautiful. Everything in the world is detailed and vibrant, The colors are right on point and the framerate stays respectable throughout the game. I would have preferred if the developers worked more to get the game sixty frames per second instead of making it 1080p. But i still think the solid 30 frames per second frame lock is fine. The story that the game tells may not be original in the slightest but it sure does manage to tell the story well. The Trevor sections felt less inspired compared to the rest of the game. He felt like he was in the game just to give the famous Grand Theft Auto rampages more of a plot behind it. During the story you will encounter heists and they are lots of fun. Online have been added but at this point in time while writing the review, i have been unable to access the Rockstar servers. The heists seem to be similar to what the singleplayer offers which is a great thing if you enjoyed them like i did. The online community tends to have ruined the experience for me many times. I am not saying that everyone there is bad but from my experiences most people tend to just shoot other people on sight which is understandable for an online for a game like Grand Theft Auto. The gamemodes available in the multiplayer all feel fun and add so much variety to the game. The game is filled with content that some people could take as offensive. I personally was fine with it because i see it just as a work of art that is not afraid to be uncensored. There is not really a way to avoid the offensive content in the game which could make some players avoid the title. The only time i had trouble with some of the scenes were in one mission that involved torturing a man to get information out of him. Some of the scenes of torture that you controlled were hard to watch at times. If you like singleplayer focused games and games with large open worlds. This game was meant for you.

I must say it has, and it has a lot more color than the others. This game centers on three criminals hoping to make it big in the world of bank robberies. My favorite character was Michael, since he was the most relatable of the three. Franklin just came across as a sarcastic snob and Trevor, was well, Trevor. Michael seemed like an actual human being and responds to situations in the most fitting way possible. The story was pretty engaging, but it lost me a couple times in terms of pushing the story along. For example, one mission had me torturing a guy for intel. Afterwards, he said he would have just given it up. It left a question, why didn't he? And what was the information for anyway? All it said is that the other agency was going to get it first, so we could have been killing Miss Daisy for giving one of the agents a funny look at the intersection for all I knew. I also realized another plot hole. Couldn't the whole FIB thing have been avoided if Michael had just said screw you all and walked out the door? Trevor didn't seem to inconvenience him at all when he returned, even when he found out about his secret. His presence in Michael's life made as much of an impact as his long lost dog returned home after running away for being used as a weapon to smash yet another TV. After the campaign ended, the game got bland pretty quick. Doing side missions made as much difference to my experience as the fly that landed on my shoulder while I was driving down the highway, so I didn't even bother after about two of them.

However, even though GTAV is a great game that is providing me with lots of fun,  i've gotten way more fun from previous GTA titles. GTAV is an undeniably an amazing technical achievement. It is just the map, the story and lack of content that lets it down. My favourite GTA game is GTA San Andreas from 2004. I'm still playing it 11 years on. The map was huge, extremely varied and well made, the story was brilliant fun and the gameplay and game world was brilliant fun. So when i heard GTAV was returning to San Andreas i got super excited. But then after i got my hands on the game and made my way around the map. It just isn't that varied. They say it is bigger than GTA San Andreas and several other game worlds combined. But it doesn't even feel bigger than GTA San Andreas. The original GTA San Andreas map is so so varied it never gets boring, even 11 years on. GTAV's map got boring pretty quickly. The story is real bad and just plain boring. It is knowehere near as deep as previous GTA games. Maybe because in GTAV you have 3characters to play which bounce off each other. So there really isn't much time or room for them to develop. My favourite GTA story was GTAIV and the character Niko Bellic by a long way. That story was amazing. Sadly GTAV is probably the worst story in the series. The missions simply aren't as fun or as varied as previous GTA games either. I found them a boring chore rather than fun. This time the missions involve planning and prepping ready for bigger heists. The planning and prepping is just plain dull and very basic like the story.

Anyways, we all know what a GTA game is by now.  Open world, complete freedom, and larger than life characters.  In the 5th installment you play as 3 different characters.  There is  Franklin.  The fun loving, grew up in the hood but wants more out of life kinda guy.  There is Micheal.  The middle aged bank robber who was relocated in the witness protection program as well as his small fortune and dysfunctional family.  Then there is my personal favorite, Trevor.  Trevor is your all but typical wild card.  He has several screws loose but hes insanely intelligent.  Its just hidden behind a red-neck, hillbilly exterior.  Trevor is a DIY kinda guy with a nasty temper.  These three characters allow you to see from each person's perspective.  All motivated by their own desires this makes for an interesting trio.  All that said, I am not sure I really like being 3 different people.  I feel like you lose out on that feeling of building an \"empire\" like the last few GTA games.  Every time I switch characters I am reminded that this is a video game.  You are probably thinking \"well, no sh@t its a video game.\"  I'm just saying it constantly disconnects you through the whole switching process, quite literally I might add.  Other than that any gripes I had are pretty much non-existent.  It is a near perfect game.  If you can think it you can do it, which makes for a pretty fun time.  First person mode was also implemented and even though it has it's flaws during certain actions like getting to cover it works really well, and almost turns GTA 5 into a whole different game believe it or not.  The visuals are amazing, and much better than the ps3 version (not that the PS3 version looked bad at all).  Draw distances are way better.  If it rains there are actual puddles that form in the street after which you can actually see reflections in the water.  All in all its astonishing to look at.  Most of the missions are pretty fun, some may seem repetitive at times, but they all get you closer to success.  You will come across some missions that are basically heists.  It gives you the ability to plan and select other criminals that specialize in certain things like hacking, driving, or combat.  Everyone knows heists never go quite as planned so it can lead to some really interesting outcomes.  If you are that one guy or gal that hasn't played GTA 5 yet you really should.

At least i think it's a special race, it's never explained where she came from or how/why she has these powers. I personally like to think she is a prostitute on a really good ecstasy and cocaine high and the game takes place in her dream state. She runs around in her lingerie, which no one seems to question what so ever, and she is immune to all fall damage so i think the theory holds up pretty well. You even meet another Shifter along the way, and she's dressed in even skimpier lingerie than Kat, so it seems all the prostitutes in the city have teamed up to fight crime. But i digress. Kat also will not be confused for a brainiac. Early in the game she falls into a sewer and instead of being disgusted like most normal folks would be, she decides to build a home out of the biggest pipe she can find.

There are things like Flowers,Leafs and Packets to also help you get around and hopefully not fall back to the beginning.

It has a nice theme and soundtrack; although there's no real story and the aesthetics could do with a bit more work. It is however, a wacky game with some comical moments. The gameplay is a nice mix of platforming and combat; with the mechanics being particularly refreshing. Despite the relatively large set of actions, it doesn't feel overwhelming. The dimension-swapping is used particularly well throughout the game. Its semi-open-world nature allows for some additional challenges, side quests and collectibles. The enemies aren't repetitive and are satisfying to fight against. Combat is simple and intuitive but has enough depth to avoid repetition - especially given the variety of enemies and the use of dimensions and shields which require special moves to break. However, the game falls short at times chiefly because of the way it handles two players on screen. If you are playing as a guest on a local system, Player 1 always has \"priority\" meaning that if the guest overcomes a platforming section whilst Player 1 fails, the game has a 3 second timer for which, regardless of where you may be, the guest is respawned back to where Player 1 is. The \"bubble\" used to spawn players is particularly annoying as having to navigate to where the other player is isn't always easy when the screen is cluttered with enemies. The game also has far too much combat relative to platforming; which is a shame given the excellent platforming mechanics which can only really be appreciated fully in the Infierno challenges. If the game had more of these challenges, it would be better. The character customisation is nice and simple but could allow for more options. It is often difficult to keep track of one's character during flashy combat sections with lots of enemies.

It is a total waste of money and a disgrace to all of the previous guitar hero games. The idea of being live on stage is cool but they totally missed their mark on this one. Every song is prerecorded so every time you play it the scene is exactly the same and trust me it gets old very fast. Also, you play in front of the most bipolar crowd I have ever seen. One second they love you but miss a couple notes and they'll start throwing **** at you and then two seconds later when you hit a few notes they're back to jumping and screaming your name. It is so unrealistic and cheesy that you feel like a stranger on stage. The guitar is hands down the cheapest and poorly made guitar in the series to date. It feels more hollow than ever and you can hardly hear music because the strum bar is so loud. It honestly feels like a cheap third party controller. The gameplay is horrendous and notes are missed all the time either because the guitar is so ****ty or just because the game sucks, could be both. The song selection for the live mode is very scarce with very few actual rock songs or even songs with a notable guitar track. You'll find yourself playing skrillex and eminem on stage at a rock concert-it just makes no sense. Not saying that I don't like those artists because I do but I would rather play songs that actually have guitar in them. Putting these genres into the game was a good idea but it was made to be too big a part of the game. There are only 42 songs in the game and half of them don't even belong there. The guitar hero TV part is the only thing this game has going for it but you need a playstation plus account just play it and even then you have to pay to play the songs because you only have a certain amount of plays. There are some pretty good songs on this mode I'll admit but you can't even play them unless you pay or wait around for that song to be on one of the two free channels they so generously give you. If you are trying to decide whether to buy Guitar Hero Live or Rock Band 4 I beg you to buy Rock Band. It may be a bit more expensive but it will be worth it because guitar hero live is a piece of **** and the makers of this game obviously don't give two ****s about its users.
