The combat flows better than ever and the animations really give you a brutal sense of joy when you go to clobbering a bunch of brutes in a dark alley.  Some complain that it is a bit button mashy, and I agree that overall it is, but that doesn't make it any less fun.  I like to focus on the beatdown I'm unleashing rather than complex button combinations.  To add some complexity you can really focus on using the various finishers that become available or you can change the difficulty and play without prompts to block/evade.  This makes fighting a large group substantially more difficult without changing the experience too much.  The upgrade system as been changed a little bit.  You get upgrade points by completing side missions and can spend at your discretion.  This is a nice way to incentivize the side missions.

Every detail and situation fits together perfectly making this the best batman game by rock steady. The batmobile however is a great thing they added to the game.

Little did I know."], ["MannWithNoEyes", "User", "5", "Batman: Arkham Knight is a passable finale in the best video game superhero franchise yet. In terms of story, while it does try to attain a darker tone than the rest of the Arkham series, in my opinion I don't think it went all out in doing so, so its story was never as engaging as the more insane but still more emotional and intriguing story from Arkham City. Similarly, despite the skill tree seemingly implying a more in-depth and complicated combat system, the combat is still extremely simplistic, but it's still flashy enough to be engaging for a few hours. However the end of the game is hindered by the amount of health the enemies have, or by the sheer numbers of enemies in an area, which results in certain fights lasting too long for this very simple and easy combat system. This is not to say that I hate when games are easy, but for me, issues surface when lack of difficulty is caused by or amplified by shallow mechanics. For example, Horizon: Zero Dawn's dinosaur combat is pretty easy, but keeps itself fresh through consistent changes to the enemies throughout the fight, where Batman's combat drones on and on without ever feeling the need to change anything based on environment, enemy health, or enemy numbers. The detective segments are hit-or-miss as well. These rarely work, so they often feel disjointed because they go on for longer than they should, and are very restrictive because there's no room for the player to come to conclusions on their own. In one segment, Batman has to determine where a car which holds his friend is going, so the process is to click on the square with the guy holding his friend, and then click on the car he went to. This is just way too simple to be entertaining. On the other hand, the stealth segments are very well crafted. In this aspect I think this game really benefits from having an open world. Due to the fact that every area is an actual place in the world it allows these segments to feel really interconnected with the rest of the game, instead of just separate challenges. Furthermore, due to the fact that there is more variation in terms of architectural structure than nearly every other open-world game with a city as its backdrop, there is real variation in the layout of most segments, which I thought was amazing considering how many games set in a city play the same no matter where mission takes place. Watch Dogs 2 is a great example of this. Also the side quests are all pretty great and entertaining even without extensive rewards. Despite its numerous improvements, however, there are still many areas in which this game fails as an open-world game. The Batmobile combat is as simplistic as the hand-to-hand combat, but lacks the aspects which made the hand-to-hand combat effective. It's repetitive and is used extremely often, which makes entire segments stale and boring. Besides that, multiple main story missions have these really annoying moments where all you do is follow these trails laid out by the game. These are never as satisfying as finding out which way to go on your own. Even in small amounts the Riddler Trophies don't offer the convenience that Breath of the Wild's Korok seeds do. No doubt, Breath of the Wild's Korok seeds are too abundant to actually be called anything but a nuisance if trying to collect all of them, but they're forgivable because in small doses these mini-challenges offer a short diversion from whatever it is the player is doing. They make the world constantly engaging, and reward exploration in all areas of the map because they're so abundant. What separates them from the trophies, however, is how they offer periodic rewards. There is no reason to collect all 900, because with 100, your inventory is large enough to make it through the game with minimal issues. The Riddler Trophies do not encourage exploration because they're all marked on the map, and do not function as short diversions because in order for them to be worth anything, all 400 need to be collected. This is so tedious that the reward, which is an underwhelming boss, is by no means worth the effort. Despite in my opinion having numerous flaws which considerably worsened my experience, there were enough moments which were entertaining or creative that the result is a game that gets a pass, but not much more. So Batman: Arkham City gets a 5 out of 10.

If not, go and play Arkham City instead. Arkham Knight's gameplay is monotonous. I repeat, MONOTONOUS. Driving around copied and pasted streets in the batmobile fighting endless hordes of mindless robots summarises at least 50-60% of the game. What should actually be a minor feature is instead a massive chunk of the gameplay. However, that's not the only thing Arkham Knight does wrong. The level design is AWFUL. It's very unclear, most of the time you have no idea where you're supposed to be going. The story is slightly contrived in parts, but otherwise, fine.

Where the game lacks at is the overuse of the Batmobile and a bit of lack in the story. Some parts of the game overuse the Batmobile in mission and can kind of get very tedious, but don't get me wrong because the Batmobile is still a very fun tool to use sometimes. The only part in the story that left me disappointed in was the super predictiable twist, I won't spoil anything though.

The negative point that I will give to this otherwise fantastic game is that it takes a little too long to rev up to a consistently varied and dynamic experience.  During the first 20 minutes you're engaged in an interesting story but it takes another hour to open up the world in a meaningful way.

Rocksteady has promised there will be added focus on main gameplay with added villains and mission via DLC in the coming months, which I'm sure will balance things out as far as that problem is concerned. When all is said and done; without disclosing details on the story, this is enjoyable from the start to finish. The Freeflow combat system has come through improved again, with new ways to take down enemies and a fresh 'fear' takedown system which was really awesome to use, allowing Batman to take down multiple enemies granted they can't see you coming, which frankly makes a lot of the far more overwhelming and challenging combat missions more manageable. And for any fellow paranoid gamers out there like myself I will set your mind at ease in saying that this game managed to escape the Mass Effect 3 curse of having a terrible ending for a third game, as after you've poured hours into getting that 100% completion the ending is very fulfilling.

My advice would be 'don't just throttle the campaign', allow yourself to make use of the mission wheel that will have you up to all sorts of additional content, and this is where you will find many new concepts in the game.

Definitely use the 'toggle battle mode' in the game options if you prefer a traditional L2/R2 brake setup, and would prefer not to have to hold down a button at all times to remain in battle mode.

The gloomy atmosphere along with the amazing little details, from the rain slithering down the batsuit, to the quirky background conversations/interactions. Rocksteady have reignited the Arkham series after the disappointing Arkham Origins. The story is engaging (as expected, due to no multiplayer) and has varied side missions which are highly entertaining, especially the Riddler puzzles which add another aspect by including the batmobile. Whilst on the topic of the batmobile, in all honesty, it was a let down. It is relied upon too heavily at times, and although it's fun to powerslide across Gotham city, personally it detaches from the 'Batman' feel of the game. I much prefer gliding across the city like a bad-ass butterfly. The add ons (Harley Quinn, Red-hod and Scarecrow mission packs) are also very entertaining, but quite short. The combat is what makes the game in my opinion. The freeflowing combos and the addition of the fear attack, makes the melee engrossing and addictive. Nothing better than beating the crap out of a thug, in true emphatic Batman-fashion. The options to plan out your attacks is also a great feature, which gives you more choice and makes the game more strategic.

Another thing is, is that I was scared of the possibility of a empty Gotham.

I give a 10 because people giving it a 0 and thinking their opinion matters are absurd. The batmobile is over used yes but it isnt as bad as people make it sound. I recommend playing, the graphics are some of the best, the framerate is the most stable i have experience on ps4 since it has been out. The main problem was how short the main story is. When you create such a massive world, why is it so hard to make the storyline 40 hours instead of 8. Anyways, play it if you havent, it is the best in the series."], ["ToFewViews", "User", "9", "Arkham Knight picks up the story of Arkham City right where it left off, But in Arkham Knight Scarecrow and the other villains have planned a massive take over of Gotham and Scarecrow threatens to poison the city with his \"Fear Toxin\" Witch leaves the city next to empty except for Looters,Rioters and the \"Arkham Knight's\" Militia. The Arkham Knight is the some what focus of this game (Hints the name) and he is a unknown villain hell bent on bringing Batman to his kneels and getting his revenge. Him and his Men are the most prepared and well armed when it comes to fighting the Batman. The combat to the game is very fluid and smooth with only a few times where you get mad at Batman for not doing even remotely close to what you wanted him to, other then those odd points the combat is very enjoyable. The environments mostly give you multiple ways to handle a situation  rather it be stealth from below/above or a all out brawl or something in-between. The addition of the Batmobile adds a whole new level of combat to the game with the ability to call in the Tank/Super Car with a press of a button  you are able to use it to take out enemy checkpoints, Tanks or whatever you need. The Batmobile is extremely fun to drive with it smashing through parts of builds and pushing cars, Also drifting corners and hitting jumps is fun. There are a few Riddler challenges and story missions that build some puzzles around the Batmobile witch can get boring and repetitive but still nice to see them work the vehicle into some puzzles. The game is also full of things to do with tons of side missions to track down and finish, from Hostage's to save,Murders to Solve or other villains to hunt down and lock up. The story to me was a amazing story exploring points of the Batman universe that are extremely well known and close to the fans of the series, anyone who is a slight fan of the Batman universe will instantly love the story of Arkham Knight.The game looks beautiful, Environments are extremely detailed and it gives the feeling of immersion and really pulls you into the story.Arkham Knight Isn't a perfect game but it's really close, if you a fan of past Batman games or a Batman Nerd like myself you will love this game but if your not invested in the world of Batman you may not have the same experience but I'm sure it'll still be enjoyable."], ["SWERY_51", "User", "8", "So far the best super-hero game ever.

They have a great mix of difficulty, however, Arkham knight was very difficult. Mostly the driving. I love that in the Arkham series that each game is an improvement from the previous game. Most games diminish in quality as the series continues. Also I love that they improve the game without taking away what makes the series great. A great variety of characters that you normally don't get to see are seen, but I felt that the villains were scarcily seen. I love that this game makes you feel more like a detective with more uses of gadgets and investigations. The graphics are beautiful and gameplay is smooth but very hard at times. The batmobile mechanics are cool. I won't reveal much but you'll be surprised what it is capable of. On to the cons. There are hardly any boss fights and the ones that are in it are ridiculously easy. Nothing like the great boss fights of Arkham Origins. There are several villains in this game, I would have love to actually fought them. The game set an entirely different mood than the previous games since the city is empty throughout 99.9% of the game. The setting was in my opinion depression. Still this game is worth trying.

If you don't know too much than you will probably like it more than i did. The whole Tim Drake / Barbara Gordon thing comes out of left field and really isn't necessary. I mean actually the Arkham Unhinged comic actually says Grayson and Gordon had a past relationship. Which makes it wierd to the point it is actually distracting. Tim is practically Barbara's little brother. They could have inserted Spoiler into Barbara's kidnapping position and at least I wouldn't reject it. The Arkham Knight's identity I figured out 6 months ago when they first announced it so that fell a little flat. I mean really what major Batman character is missing and could possibly fit the bill. But they did do some really amazing story-telling tricks with flashbacks that I loved. Also the Joker was very entertaining. Moving to missions - Locking out the other islands or gadgets required for side missions makes going out and doing them in the first place difficult. I did Nightwing's because it was so easy and requires practically nothing. Which is not very rewarding to not be challenged in the slightest. This also bugged me that they blew off Batman's greatest ally with the excuse of \"Oh no... You have to watch Bludhaven\" Yeah like that place has Scarecrow toxin turning into a literal hell. There are some really annoying bits about trying to find easy objectives in some instances that make the game really frustrating. Like being stuck in a room for 5 minutes running in circles trying to find the right door to go in because I could not find a single bit of orange. when the Batmobile was chased by one of the big tanks it would switch the camera view to this camera that was really far and even the car's controls felt different. That would end up getting me killed several times easily. But after a while I actually like the Batmobile gameplay in general it was a very cool and different addition. Oh and the no loading screen thing is cleverly disguised with the old Mass Effect elevators trick. The first 'ending' was okay, if it was an actual ending it would be great, but even the post-knightfall ending was just... not good. So Batman gives himself a superpower of being part-scarecrow, really? The whole Tim/Barbara getting engaged thing was like a cherry on top of just a story I really didn't care for. I know a lot of these things are nitpicky but too bad, I spent $100 bucks on this thing.

First of all, hiding your \"real end\" behind total completion is a practice I don't agree with, it just causes players to drag themselves through tasks they may not be interested in to see a few seconds to get \"the full story\". Besides that, I have never been too much of a fan of the combat and Predator mode, just always felt gimmicky with difficulty increases by throwing a ton more guys at you.

At the same time, that giant gas bomb gives a good reason for the city to be entirely empty except for thousands of henchmen and rioters and a few policemen and firefighters. Right there is a missed opportunity to rescue a few stragglers who refused to get on the buses. Rescuing the firefighters was actually quite enjoyable and made me feel like Batman. At the same time, some of the other missions felt tacked on. Chasing Firefly was a lazy excuse to further justify the existence of the Batmobile. Testing Azrael was little more than a combat challenge and busting two face was just a run of the mill stealth challenge. It was still enjoyable, but wasn't as special as it could've been considering this was the last installment. Chasing man-bat was different and tracking the pig-man was excellent but way too easy. I feel there was an opportunity for greater involvement with allies and the rogue's gallery. I'm sure more will be added by dlc. Probably not enough to make me return to the game. A major critique is the Bat-weapon-of-mass-pacification. Having the Batmobile as it was is completely against character. It was a tank with guns. Further, to justify its presence there are unmanned tanks. This in itself is a logic gap. The Arkham Knight, knowing Batman would never intentionally kill but wanting to destroy Batman wouldn't just put guys in the tanks, he'd strap innocent people to the armor. Further, the Riddler \"trials\" were not just tedious but infuriating. Having to collect all the trophies (and yes I eventually did because I'm a masochist) to get the actual ending is just mean. Didn't we complain about the copious Riddler trophies in the last installment? There were shining moments in the plot, in layout of the missions, and the pure breath of this installment. But large parts were additions that weren't needed and ripoffs that were done right the first time. The Arkham Knight / Red Hood plot point was very heavy handed and way too obvious even after we were told the Knight would be a \"new\" character. It was fun being Batman once more, but it was better the first time... And the second time."], ["Polmanteer", "User", "7", "Overall the game is very good and a joy to play.  If you're reading this you likely already know about the port issues so I'll leave those and address only things that are not platform specific.  There are a few glaring bugs still present in the game which is why I scored it as a 7 where it could have been higher.  One of my personal pet peeves is when my control over my character is taken away or diminished, something this game does often.  I could overlook it if not for the many unskippable cut-scenes and activities where I'm stripped of all my control and gadgets save one for some specific action that must be taken.  It's this mechanic that has caused one of the more troublesome glitches where you become stuck because the game has again limited your ability to control Batman but hasn't provided the object you are supposed to interact with, thus leaving you stuck forever with no choice but to start over or quit.  Despite these flaws the game is still enjoyable and I'd say if you're a fan of the series the game is very much worth picking up, though I'd look for it on sale as it's not worth full price in it's current somewhat buggy state.  If not for the bugs I'd give it an 8 or 9.  If not for all the times in game where I lose control of my avatar for nothing more than a cut-scene or one of the several times I'm forced to stand around and watch scenes play out while I'm restricted to doing nothing but watching (with no way to skip ahead) I would score it higher still."], ["sedoi", "User", "5", "Finally finished this yesterday."], ["Ghoster", "User", "8", "First of all, this game run awesome on PS4 and FPS is more than satisfying.

Arkham City remains the best game in th series."], ["GamerJosh0137", "User", "8", "Thanks to the somewhat slow passed couple months in the gaming industry I have been able to chip away at my backlog.  Batman Arkham Knight was a game I desperately wanted to play when it first released but unfortunately I never got around to it.  Mostly due to the story being spoiled for me a few months after release.  Anyway, enough of that.  Batman Arkham Knight is a whole lot like Arkham City.  Like Arkham City, Batman Arkham Knight is an open world but this time you are actually defending Gotham City from Scarecrow and his sidekick The Arham Knight.  Long story short Batman AK is a fantastic game that strives really hard to be as good, if not better than Arkham City.  Though a fantastic game, in my opinion it doesn't quite reach Arkham City.  I think my main problem is the batmobile.  The batmobile is now apart of your Batman as much as his cape.  It's being used almost constantly and though I understand that Rocksteady needed a solution to having a huge open world game and no fast travel.  That is where the Batmobile comes in, and unfortunately over stays it's welcome.  Don't get me wrong.  The Batmobile is a necessity when you are fighting a huge private army, who happen to own thousands of tank drones.  The problem is that the momentum of the game comes to a screeching halt when you get somewhere infested with these tank drones.  It then just turns into a continuous bore of strafe, fire, strafe, fire, strafe, fire, strafe, fire.  It just isn't fun.  Fortunately though, the rest of the game is so good it completely over shadows these issues.  The story is great, and I REALLY love what they do with the Joker now that he is dead.  You will see what I mean if you play it.  Batman Arkham Knight is a very good ending to this great series, and I can't wait to see what Rocksteady does next."], ["ParkerRose", "User", "7", "This game is fun. Incredibly fun.

For many people it was, and for good reason. The trailers and gameplay footage shown off at preview events was nothing short of incredible. The visuals, scale and narrative all suggested a game that would easily be a game of the year contender. Not to mention, the pedigree this series has. The Arkham series was a game changer in the industry, in that licensed super hero games could actually stand up to the very best games of that year. Make no mistake Arkham knight is a great game but unfortunately, that is all it merely is. Arkham knight delivers on a lot of its promises, the visuals are absolutely stunning; some of the best this generation in fact. The scale of the game, too, is also impressive. Gotham is certainly larger than Arkham city, in terms of landscape and things to do. However maybe its too much, too many side missions and things to do. Arkham knight seems to lack focus and it overall takes away from the experience. After completing the main story, the player is forced to complete all SIDE objectives to obtain the final ending. Meaning the side content, ironically, is part of the main content in the game. And while the side content is enjoyable, it exists to simply lengthen the game. Same can be said for some of the tank missions, for which there are too many and take away from the experience. The game becomes less immersive and instead becomes a series of boxes to tick. Arkham knight unfortunately doesn't feel like the epic batman experience many were hoping for, but merely a very good batman game. Arkham city felt like, however, an experience and more than just a game. The player was fully immersed in its open world and its narrative to become a batman experience. I spent far less time playing Arkham city than knight, however I treasure it more. It's such a shame, because the narrative of Arkham Knight is compelling with unexpected twists and turns. However this is overshadowed by the needless number of tank missions and side missions in the game. Arkham knight starts off strong and feels like the epic batman experience players waited patiently for. But eventually it becomes a Ubisoft-like open world game where the player does 8 of the same thing. Meaning it's a lot of fun, but feels somewhat formulaic and repetitive.

You hardly spent any time outside the batmobile before you need to use it to progress. Although the combat against unmanned drones is well designed, it feels lifeless and overused. Most of the bossbattles are recycled batmobile fights, as opposed to unique bossfights seen in the other games.

This story is fairly good, although many of the other main villains such as penguin and twoface are pushed into sidequests, leaving little room for new villains to be introduced. The reveal of the Arkham Knight's identity is well done as an adaption of a classic batman story, but is nothing new to the series as they promoted him to be. There is a glaring lack of challenge maps that were found in the previous games, there only being 3 predator and 4 combat, and far too many batmobile maps in place.

There was promise here and there with some of the villains (not going to give away who) but I was left feeling disappointed. It just felt like a bland tv show.

Choose between being an insanely violent Batman, or the Batman with \"rules\", and decide the direction of Gotham and its people.  The only obstacle I faced when it comes to WANTING to play more was the first episode.  The first episode is clearly an introduction to who Bruce Wayne and he came to be Batman.  We all know how Bruce Wayne came to be Batman.  I thought the introduction was completely redundant.  That said, after that I was totally hooked.  So many twists and turns, not to mention choices that really made me consider the consequences for.  It was not easy.  My biggest gripe is the engine.  Outdated and inconsistent the so called Telltale tool engine is a \"ball and chain\" to telltale games.  Horrid frame rates, consistent crashes and sometimes ridiculous lag spikes really take away from the overall experience.  I just don't get it.  This engine has been a problem for Telltale since the first Walking Dead season.  Several series, and seasons later we are still seeing the same, which gives me the impression that Telltale just doesn't care.  They really should because it is starting to show incompetence.  Telltale games aren't doing anything technically demanding.  It is simple as simple can be so my question is why?  Why can't we get these games running as intended?  Supposedly the engine used for Batman is a new engine yet here we are again.  Ok.  Rant over.  Despite all of that, Batman is worth playing, and at 25 bucks its a lot of bang for your buck.  A note to Telltale if they happen to see this:  Please, Please, Please for the love of Christ, fix your engine!

So all in all, Batman: A telltale series is a flawed game that nevertheless presents an overall well crafted story of the dark knight and it's probably the best game to handle the Bruce Wayne part of the character so far, and that barring a few disappointing moments, it does things well enough to satisfy me as a fan.

It's a failure as a point and click adventure. That said, the animation is great, fluid, much better than any animated Batman movie or TV show. The acting is excellent, and the story so far seems great too. As a Batman animated movie, this might be a 10, better than all the rest. But as a game it's just too easy. Unbelievably easy. I wish Telltale games would put some effort into their games' difficulty. They can include the game as-is, but make that the super easy setting for non-gamers. They can add meaningful choices and real puzzles that actually require thought, for a harder setting. Telltale has everything in place to make games that are every bit as good as Lucas Arts in its heyday, but they just don't seem to want to go there, preferring instead to make games that look fantastic and tell great stories, but really do not rate as games at all.

The gameplay itself feels very much like Borderlands, although the art direction is less comic book and more Saturday morning cartoon. Anyone looking for top notch graphics will be dissatisfied but I personally enjoy cel shading, it reminds me of the ps2 era in HD. Single player is broken into multiple raids lasting a half hour to an hour, they feel fast and give a nice tutorial for characters and their skill trees which reset adter a match. Pvp is a mixed bag for me, it can either be mildly fun in short bursts or very frustrating due to varying skill levels of randoms in matchmaking. The maps are also very dull, lacking verticality or multiple lanes, theyre mostly very linear and small with little breathing room for exaping ganks. This is disappointing compared to the large open campaign maps. The game really feels like a mixed bag and ultimately will most likely be overshadowed in the coming months by Blizzards Overwatch and Epic games Paragon.

Never before have I thought an EA-Dice game could impress me this much. When I first heard about it, I loved the idea of a WW1 shooter. When I played the beta, I was honestly disappointed. When I finally picked up the game, I was immediately hooked. It had one of the best intros I've ever seen in a video game.

I will admit that I enjoyed some more than others, but the overall experience is good. It is short, however, only running at about 6-7 hours long. But the multiplayer is where Battlefield 1 truly stands out. All of the regular Battlefield modes have been  brought back, but one new addition is Operations, in which you take over territory on a large map, then push forward to a different map once you've taken the first one. It's easily the best part of Battlefield 1, and I've already invested a number of hours into it. Some of my favorite moments have come from playing Operations, and I have no doubt that they'll keep coming. Now I bet a lot of you are asking the same question: does this game have microtransactions? Well no, actually. Points to EA because you can't purchase Battlepacks with actual money. I didn't expect to see restraint from them in this area. One problem that I do have with this game is all of the \"coming soon\" options you see in the menu. It's clear that this will be included as DLC down the line. It's a minor problem, but that and the short length of the campaign keep Battlefield from being a 10.

This unfortunately goes right into the battle pack system with the parts of weapons being unlocked rather than an entire firearm. The lack of weapons and gear to unlock makes every unit operate pretty much the same where as in previous entries you could mix and match to find what works best for you.

But seeing the gameplay and the trailer, it is unbelievably fantastic and stunning.  Just seeing the gameplay and improvements makes the gamer get into the action and play more.  The big question, is this the best Battlefield game ever made of the franchise?  When the first trailer came out, I watched it and first thing I thought was, \u201cWow this is WW1 I\u2019m seeing\u201d.  And also seeing the gameplay makes more exciting and intense.  And this totally made me buy the game, and playing is breathtaking.  The game was fantastic, you get to play in the trenches, dog fights, ride horses, improved graphics, the savagery fight, and more destruction and chaos.  Also multiplayer is really great, my favorite mode of playing multiplayer is operations, it\u2019s a large scale map, and you either need to defend your sectors or conquer it.  If you are someone that is a gamer and loves to play first shooter games but not those future fake warfare stuff, then I recommend buying this game.  I think people would love this game because this is actual warfare that took place 100 years ago, and this game is very realistic to play.  My preference of games, I like the realistic war games, either something in the past or modern.  Now like future wack games like call of duty, to me they took it into future games, and that\u2019s when I lost my favor of call of duty.  So this makes Battlefield 1 the best game made in the battlefield franchise."], ["criticvideogame", "User", "9", "The best battlefield, with an admirable campaign excellent multiplayer design great atmosphere remote visual incredible.

Yea, but if I'm in WW1, and I hear a gunshot behind me, I'm going to instantly turn around. Radar in video games is just a way to incorporate being able to hear a gunshot in real life. With no radar, most of your deaths end up by somebody you had no clue where they were, and you feel cheated. They weren't better than you.. They just happened to be looking your direction while you were looking another direction. This has been the formula for Call of Duty for years, and I guess a lot of people enjoy it but not I. I want to know where I'm taking fire from, so I can combat it, and the better person wins. This is not the case with Battlefield 1. I'm tired of playing first person shooters and getting shot in the back. I want to know where my enemy is, engage them, and if I'm the better aim, I'll win the battle.

I am not surprised at all by how much I love this game.  Ever since the beta I couldn't wait for this game to finally come out, even securing the early enlister edition to get a few days ahead.  Battlefield 1 imo feels like a \"back to the basics\" type of fps.  No more guns with laser sites, calling in a laser guided missiles from a satellite via computer, or trying to shoot players running on walls.  Just your basic run around with the familiar \"Battlefield\" tradition.  All your favorite Battlefield modes are back.  Conquest, Rush, Team Deathmatch, etc.  My new favorite mode though is operations.  I don't want to say what it is because I wan't you to experience it yourself but it is effing awesome!  Conquest of coarse has always been my favorite, along with Rush but Operations is a great way to mix it up a bit while adding somewhat of a history lesson.  Gun play is great, and I have noticed that with these less reliable, older guns it is not as easy to get a kill as it used to be.  The general rate of fire is a bit slower all around.  I thought I was going to like all the machine guns a lot more than everything else but honestly the semi-automatics are what I like to use best now, which is weird because I never liked the semi-auto rifles in previous Battlefield games.  Only because I was never very good with them.  The tanks are pretty cool, all ranging from your giant devastators to your little one man machines.  The planes are actually my favorite though.  You got your bombers, attack planes and fighter planes.  All of which have their advantages.  Bombers are slow and heavy but deal an incredible amount of damage with 2 different types of bombs that drop 10's at a time.  The attack planes I believe are for attacking ground targets and such, then the fighters are your dog fighting planes.  They are super fast with machine guns, and rockets.  The rockets are cool because there is no lock on or anything so you genuinely need to time them just right if you intend on hitting enemy fighters, but if you do the enemy does not typically survive.  I am sure you all know about the horse by now, which was a bit op in the beta but they have since nerfed a bit so it is not quite as easy to decimate entire teams with nothing but a saber lol.  If you have been playing battlefield since the early 2000's I think you will be surprised.  The campaign is so far pretty good.

I ran over a guy laying in front of me three times in a row with my horse and he just shot me off, which made me feel like a total idiot. Also, why did DICE make the rear facing machine guns on planes so powerful? Those machine guns do so much more damage than the actual machine guns on the fighter planes that it is nearly impossible to destroy a plane you're chasing if that plane has even a decent gunner on board. Why do you have to unlock pistols for every class, and why do different classes have different pistols? They're just pistols. Let me get a decent pistol for the scout class; the class is already bad enough for close quarters combat. The final scout rifle you unlock is a joke; it's no more powerful than the ones you unlock at level 1, though it shoots one bullet before you have to reload. Anti air guns, even if they don't hit your plane cause it to bounce around as if it is entering a sharknado. I'm sure I could go on, but as I've indicated, the game is not perfect; and some of the 'balancing' Dice has done since the beta (the light tank, it shoots so incredibly slow and is so much weaker now that I personally find it nearly useless) has actually made certain features that were overpowered so underpowered that they've become useless."], ["wacousta7", "User", "3", "Had this game for two days and want a refund.

The story of Battlefield 1 cannot decide whether it's embracing the moral gray area of World War 1 or trying to be about good guys and bad guys. There may be a moment of two soldiers spotting each other from a distance and each simultaneously deciding not to kill each other, followed by a mission where it is necessary to mow down countless German soldiers in order to complete the objective. The gameplay, however, is on the complete opposite end of the spectrum. If the story was tonally inconsistent and incoherent, the gameplay never strays from monotonous, boring, and dull. There are very few changes to structure or form between this game and other generic, by the numbers FPS games. The shooting mechanics are very simple games of whack-a-mole, but in this aspect I do feel as though Battlefield 1 is superior to Infinite Warfare. It doesn't have the messy, over-the-top wall running or jump pack mechanics, so it's more simplistic. This results in the moment to moment gameplay being cleaner than Infinite Warfare's messy and chaotic battles. However, this works against the game in another aspect because despite not having the lows of Infinite Warfare, it cannot embrace the highs. When the movement mechanics and more frantic gunplay in Infinite Warfare work together, it can be fun and entertaining, despite how little time is spent in which the mechanics do work together. Similarly, instead of many missions being terrible and one or two being decently fun and providing some interesting moments, Battlefield 1 pumps out consistently mediocre missions without fail, and never delivers anything beyond the most basic experiences required of a shooting genre. Interlocking mechanics and physics allow for some magical moments that can be entertaining, until the repetitive missions and unoriginal story sink in. Really it's up to personal preference which is worse.

Weapon attachments are unlocked in a very smart way the only way to unlock the red dot sight for a P.D.W for example is to get a set amount of kills with that P.D.W, in addition to this battlefield 4 has added battle packs (similar to gears of war judgement's prizeboxes) these packs come in 4 varieties (bronze, silver, gold and weapon specific) each one gives you a set of randomized items including xp boosts and weapon attachments. While bronze, silver and gold packs are unlocked by leveling up weapon specific ones are unlocked by getting kills with that specific weapon.

The multiplayer side of it is everything that multiplayer should be with huge, well built fully destructible maps that, without a vehicle, would take eons to cross. Running at a smooth 1080p with 60 frames per second gameplay this is truly one of the best looking and feeling games of the next generation. So why not 10 out of 10 you ask? Well, while this game provides some of the very best multiplayer I have seen in an extremely long time, there are/were a few issues. Issue one is the campaign which, and the developers admitted this, is bland with a  generic, mediocre story. It's levels soon become stagnant with the repetitive gameplay of picking off one dumb AI at a time. But you're not here to play single player are you? I mean, who buys a Battlefield game for the single player? So, I'll move on and simply leave the campaign as not bad, but nothing we haven't seen before. So, the multiplayer, and while I must emphasise that it is now mainly a great joy to play, it wasn't always. The constant connection issues plagued what was and should have been a good game a lot earlier. Now the developers have fixed this issue, it's fine, it's fun but I'll always have the memories of waiting in a queue to join a server because it was playing that map that I adore. Waiting a few more minutes in the loading screen, then finally getting into the game, choosing my class, going out onto the battlefield to show everyone what I'm made of and... heartbreak. Disconnected again! But now, let bygones be bygones and move on because they've fixed this. Issue number three is mainly a minor one but I'm sure I'm not the only one who's come across this. The annoying hindrance that is not being able to customize your soldier, vehicles or weapons in the main menu. Just imagine it, you've just got that new gun you've been mowing down oh-so many people to get. You leave, go to the 'soldier' option in the main menu to equip it only to find that it's not there. This, while not game breaking, means that you have to find another match just to change a gun. Again, not a major issue, but like an itch on your back, it's going to cause you some minor discomfort. Aside from this Battlefield 4 is a huge step up from its predecessor Battlefield 3, with the ability to bring down dams, skyscrapers and even flood a city. It is truly an astonishing step for multiplayer and manages to finally topple its greatest of foes, Call of Duty Ghosts, from the number one spot on the multiplayer pedestal. My only advice for purchasing this game is to either get it on PC, Xbox One or the PlayStation 4.

However, the multiplayer aspect of this game is where everything clicks. Call of Duty really can't come close to this, in the sense of sheer map design & size, teamwork, realism and self satisfaction.

Also, there are the people who say that this is essentially a DLC of BF4....I must say that they are ignorant yet entitled to their opinion. You play BF4 for the Vehicular Warfare and Hardline is for the more CQ and urban warfare. That's it! You are meant to play both. BF4 is great but I have grown immensely bored with it. This game is just fine and the Net-code works great for me. If not for you then tweak you internet and router settings.....again, I have not had any issues with Net-code on this game. The feel of Hardline is faster, unlike the other BF titles. To be Honest, more players is what this game really needs at the moment. When BF4 came out everyone complained about how BF3 is superior in every way. Now they are doing the same thing again.

The shift to cop drama from war shooter was a huge risk, but I think it paid off. The story of Nick Mendoza was compelling and kept me engaged until the end. Difficulty didn't change much other than enemy bullet damage and resistance, but there was a new stealth element to the game. It does the Far Cry thing where you can throw something across the room to distract the guards to tactically take them out, but taking the barge in the front door and shoot everything on two legs wasn't that much harder, so I wasn't that compelled to take the stealthier route. The only reason that I didn't give this game a ten because there were a couple of plot holes one of which was that when you are disbanded from the police, why can you still arrest people?

This installment of Battlefield is great if you ask me, lets be real its only so many storylines worth folks time to put out here on the market for FPS game. And all the other good story lines are currently held with an title associated to them, Hardline is the most complete of the series if I must say. The feel of the game is authentic physics are better than previous titles and maps are more relatable due presenting a time current environment. To me its a waste of time to talk graphics, if any aspect of having these next gen consoles would be to expect great visuals unless you have a X1.

I understand it is not a traditional Battlefield game in that the environment is not entirely destructible (more focus on the small set pieces) and the focus on vehicle combat has been greatly reduced. The game also moves at a much faster pace, with more punishing bullet damage and a stronger emphasis on quick, calculated combat. This is Visceral's love letter to CS and Payday, and they write it beautifully. All mechanics feel smooth and load times are FAST by comparison to other Battlefield entries (from end game to new spawn maybe 30 seconds). I personally had no server issues at all in my 5 hour play test span, which is a damn miracle in itself. The gun variety is there but not overwhelming, and you need money to purchase everything (or hope you get lucky when opening a Battle Pack), so making that next purchase has a weight to it similar to that found in Payday. All modes actually feel different rather than the typical Battlefield MO of using the same mechanic is a slightly larger (or smaller) setting. The 32-32 Team Deathmatch was a blast, as well as the signature Heist mode and the Counter Strike clone mode \"Rescue\". Vehicles are a little too cut and dry, and it almost feels like they are used almost exclusively for travel purposes. The driving mechanics are solid and very reminiscent of traditional Battlefield controls and responsiveness. Gun-play is solid, not much in terms of evolution on the new engine, which is probably my biggest gripe. The game is incredibly detailed and the level design is gorgeous, but there is a TON of empty space in many levels. With the focus moving to more of a fast paced, CQC style play and vehicles being put on the back-burner, it seems strange to force these mechanics to be useful with the addition of vast, empty landscapes. However, it detracts very little from the overall experience, and having Ted Nugent belting out the lyrics to Stranglehold while I siege a mansion from the front seat of a cop car is a priceless memory I will cherish for some time. 9/10, Visceral proves they can run with a good concept, and re-imagines the world of Battlefield with great success."], ["Rair94", "User", "9", "i must atmid compare to bf4 launch with all the issues its not a bad game i'm having a blast but i feel like its gonna get boring fast thats why i didnt give it a 10"], ["AvidGamerzz", "User", "0", "Battlefield Hardline proves that replacing the franchise landmarks (large maps, wide array of vehicles and weapons) for a narrow, twitch-gameplay, cops and robbers experience is as dumb as it sounds.

You basically just get rewarded with cash for doing stuff, which would be fine but there isn't a lot to buy with the money so after a very short amount of time you will end up just sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars with nothing to buy which is irritating and seems poorly thought out by the developers. The second problem is kind of the cause of the leveling system being bad and that is the lack of gun variety. Each class has three guns to choose from, which very very limiting in a regular multiplayer game but going from BF4's huge and interesting gun library to having three guns to choose from almost breaks the experience. Having close to(I don't have time to actually count so I'm making an educated geuss) 40 guns to choose from in any given class was a core pillar of what made BF4 special.

The enemies field of view is bizarre. You can literally walk side by side an enemy and they don't notice you. At other times, I would get shot and killed even though I was out of the field of view.

The story is good enough not to get bored and the setting is refreshing. The new approach in single player works pretty good.

I'm not great at shooters, but when I get killed, i would like to see what I did wrong. In this game, there is no such thing. You get killed, but half the time, u don't know why. The killcam in this game is one of the worst i've experienced in years. I don't care what a player does after he killed me, I want to know how he killed me. The multiplayer maps are nothing special, they are not bad, but not great either. In some cases, half of the map is never used, as players stick to the same area, making some parts of the maps useless. Luckily there are vehicles to quickly skip the empty parts and the spawing in a teammates location helps. I seem to have a hard time spotting other players from a distance. In my opinion there are not a lot of game modes and some of these game modes, just look the same. The graphics are good, but I would have expected a bit more from this title.

This aspect drastically changes the experience, as even the most skilled players are mauled down by recruits with heavy arsenals. However, once you get past the rather unfair side of  Retribution, the game can actually be quite fun. Great map design and well though out game types make Retribution worth checking out. In terms of visuals, Retribution looks great for a free-to-play, but poor for a next generation title. Textures lack in detail, and none of the environments stand out.

This is a game changer for me. I hate spawning only to be killed by a sniper off in some unknown direction which happens often in typical FPS. I also hate running around looking for the fight, especially on larger maps. Blacklight solves these issues beautifully by allowing all users to find each other on the map by seeing through walls at the touch of a button. I simply love the feature. I also really like the balancing. Every gun has positive and negatives, so no gun is truly better than the default one, no matter how much you spend. In this respect, the game is really not fpay to win, unless you are horrible with a machine gun. Paying basically gives you fun tools to use, but in no way guarantees survival.

With CP, you can rent rocket launchers, heal yourself and even hop into a mech suit! there is also another currency for renting different guns and customization parts. A decent player cah have a different gun every day, since it costs the winnings of 1-2 matches to access them. Again, I'm sorry to say but most reviewers unfairly hate on this game.

Whereas in Bloodborne you have a stepmother who is a sadistic maniac who takes pleasure in your discomfort and will always find ways to torment you, no matter how well avoid her.

The way chalice dungeon multiplayer was handled is awful and I preferred Dark Souls sign system as opposed to the bell because you could tell how populated an area was in Dark Souls. The bell is convenient because it's more automatic, but it also restricts where you are summoned to where you are standing. In Dark Souls, you could leave your sign and go exploring instead of wasting time waiting at the lamp because moving would hinder the matchmaking. All in all though, these complains are petty, and I had a great time playing online with randoms and friends. The boss designs were top notch, the lore and plot was intriguing, and each and every weapon was so polished. I really liked the quality over quantity approach this game had.

Sadly it's not as easy to use as some would like but it's very helpful being able to bring you friends/randoms into boss fights to give you a hand.

Even some of the sound effects such as climbing ladders are the same exact sound texture used in Dark Souls games. The mechanics feel almost the exact same as the Souls series except they took away the shield, putting an even greater emphasis on positioning and dodging when dealing with enemies as well as adding the trick weapons instead of allowing the player to two hand weapons. In addition by adding a firearm they made a more practical riposte technique than with the poor reach of shields in Souls games. Some of my only complaints are that some of the stats are definitely more useful than others and they dumbed down some of the stat factors such as item weight and player encumberance as well as removing any type of spells like they used to have in the Souls series. In addition there is a lack of variety when it comes to the depth of items or bosses, the game takes awhile in terms of hours for your first NG because the game is not linear and doesn't always require killing bosses in a set order and the world is large and the way to continue is not always obvious. But in terms of number of bosses and variety of weapons and armor, the Souls series outshines Bloodborne in those aspects. The visual appeal of the world in Bloodborne however, are absolutely stunning. The storytelling elements in Bloodborne are identical to that in the Souls series as well, with loose cutscenes, minimal npc dialogue and interaction, and many details about the world being revealed through optional side conversations with npcs found in the universe.

It's the first game in years, in which I've actually cheered for myself after defeating a boss. Combat requires you be more offensive, as it rewards you majorly with the new \"regain system\". The way this system works is that you get hit, you lose a portion of your life, but that portion of your life is shown in a faded colour in the life-bar. You have a few seconds to get that life back by hitting the enemy as many times as you can. Guns aren't used for ranged attacks either *cue gasp* But instead, it's used as a defensive weapon, made for riposte and countering enemy attacks. That's a great idea, actually, as there's nothing more satisfying than staggering an enemy, and using a \"visceral attack\" on them. Visceral Attacks are just executions caused by countering, and give major critical damage. They can be used against bosses, at very high risk, but has to be done at least 6-7 times to them.

Grant it that you will find a lot of armor that tells you lore and backgrounds, but in the term of proficiency, if you don't look hard enough, you'll probably be stuck with the Hunter set until the Ash set.

There appears to be fewer weapons available than before -  perhaps due to the versatility of each's transformations - so instead the tactic here is to become familiar with one or two favourites.

I waited until several weeks into it to write this review. The options for your character as you progress are wide open. You develop your character how you like. The gameplay is fluid and the environments are beautiful in a very dark and eerie way. Whether you are in the city or in the woods the layout is superb. The music score is perfect to set the tone for a challenging and rewarding adventure. This game is very difficult but death comes to the impatient and foolish.

The setting and environment are some of the best ever made, it is not a typical horror game in a sense that there are jump scares and such, but it is more building tension due to the amazing orchestrated soundtracks and sound effects.

My other issue with the Souls series was a generally dated and empty feel to the design and environment. Once again, Bloodborne trumps it's predecessors and creates a living, detailed world that feels natural and exciting to explore. Now to the big point, the difficulty. In the Souls games, dying often felt unfair or forced upon you. Penalties for death were too severe and intentionally sadistic. In Bloodborne when I died, I knew it was my fault. It was either because I'd done something wrong or not been careful not because the game was artificially handicapping me by taking away my health. People complaining about the difficulty (or leaving bad reviews but not mentioning it because they don't want to sound like the suck) probably aren't playing it right. The keys are to explore everywhere, open shortcuts to find your way back faster the next time you die and to return to the Hunter's Dream frequently to buy supplies, upgrade your weapons and level up.

The enemies can and will destroy you but if you take your time to learn their attack patterns and master your own soon you will realise why you're called a hunter. If you've ever played Demon's or Dark souls games you'll know what to expect from Bloodborne, it's the same people who made those games and it's set in the same style and the same concept. It's just set at a higher more aggressive pace. If you're new to this kind of game it has a high learning curve, if you die you will restart at the beginning of the area, all of the enemies will respawn, any currency (blood echos) you gained will be lost and you will die a lot. There is no markers telling you where to go and there is no map either. But it's completely worth it if you're a gamer who likes a challenge and has a lot of time and patience to put into a game. A gamer who likes to explore and solve things for themselves. The Art style, level designee, Music, Graphics and gameplay are all top notch quality. It also has online in the form of PVP and PVE. You can invade other players worlds and battle them or you can either enter another person's game or summon them to your game and fight alongside each other against your foes.

I do not play Madden and complain I cannot slam dunk, its not NBA2K. Both sport games but both very different. This is not a normal hack an slash where you own everything. It is more of a puzzle, each enemy has a new \"Style\" of combat you figure out and over come, everything is a threat. It is not Dynasty Warriors were you run in and slash armies away with a swing of the spear. Love this game. Fun mechanics, clever and difficult layouts to levels, fun note system (yes from Dark Souls I know), and difficult. This game is for people who want a challenge.

Miyazaki created another unique, immersive, beautiful world for us to live in. I love this game.

Other than that I have a few bits of advice for new players having difficulty 1) at the start when in Iosefka's clinic, (1st room you spawn in, it is normal to have no weapon)READ  EVERYTHING! (grey messenges on the floor are a controls tutorial) This is NOT a game where ignorance of your surroundings will be rewarded in fact, it will be punished 2) Patience is essential. I cannot stress this point enough. You WILL die. I die. We ALL die. 3) Keen observation and analyzation of the enemies, their patterns, weaknesses and your surroundings is a must. 4) Don't  be GREEDY! If you have enough blood echoes (currency) to level up, buy items etc. go back to the Hunter's Dream (central hub area, accessed by pressing X at any blue lantern with little guys coming out of the ground under it)and DO IT! 5) Run past enemies, dodge (press R3 to create a lock on enemies, when said lock is visible quick dodges may be performed by pressing O and the direction you need to go in{this takes stamina, green bar under red health bar}) if you have to. Once you start leveling up your character it gets much easier and more enjoyable! 6) READ! When in the menus, for example, by reading the bottom of the screen you will find that you may often be able to press the R3 button{right thumbstick pushed inward}this will create a highlighted cursor that when moved over menu symbols will give a description of their meaning/function. 7) This game has faith in you, it believes you have the intelligence, the will, to survive, to persevere, to overcome trying obstacles without someone telling you where to go and how to get there from start to finish, as do I. Good luck, I hope this helps you out, and, may the good blood guide your way. -Devin"], ["albinvgm", "User", "10", "This game takes everything that was good from the Dark Souls series but with a fast combat and incredible weapons.

Streamlined from its predecessors to deliver fast, offense based gameplay, Bloodborne does away with some of the micromanagement and consequently some of the variety found in Souls titles. Despite these changes, the game retains highly nuanced mechanics that Souls veterans will quickly grasp, though completing the game will not come without effort. Though enemy AI can be exploited, victories in Bloodborne are won through careful navigation and timing. The world of Bloodborne is smaller than that of Dark Souls, and the game quite a bit shorter, but the experience is no less filled with hidden treasures, NPC's to interact with at various junctures, and satisfying boss battles.

The great thing about a souls game was that if you rushed into an area with little to no preparation then yo would get destroyed, but if you took the time to upgrade the correct weapons and armor, the game was much more manageable. This element is lost a little in Bloodbourne. All the souls games are difficult and bloodbourne is no exception. It does do something wrong though.

What made those games fun was the fact that it was difficult, but as soon as you failed, you started with a clean slate quickly so you didn't have to dwell on your failures. Dark souls struck a good balance of punishment and ease of death. Bloodbourne not so much. I found myself dying on a boss battle, and instead of thinking of what I would do differently next time, all I did was groan because I would have to farm more bullets and bloodvials before the next encounter.

If you are looking for change then you might like this the most. I'll only list the negatives I have as everything else is superb. Firstly, the weapons. There isn't enough diversity for me. I get the feeling I will have done every build imaginable in only ~10 runs. I just don't foresee it having the lasting appeal of previous iterations simply because of the lack of build diversity brought on by lack of equipment/weapons. Secondly, the performance. The frame drops and load times are ridiculous. I would increase it by a whole point if all they did was halve the loading times-they are soooooo long. In a 4 hour session I was stuck staring at a blank screen with the logo on it for about an hour, not good. There were also a few points where it would drop to sub 20 fps and get really choppy. Thirdly, the environments. I just don't think there is enough variety.  I am already getting sick of gothic castle. Fourth, and lastly, I'm not as big of a fan of the combat as previous games. It feels a little dumbed down (could also feel that way just because of the lack of diversity) but in making it much more aggressive I feel it dropped some of the depth it had. Other players will definitely find that improvement, but I don't much care for it. I would have preferred the more slow paced combat of previous games. Overall it is a fantastic game and a definite buy if you are a souls fan. It's a shame they will be keeping it ps4 exclusive because of the performance issues but if you can get past those you might find the best iteration of the franchise thus far. If you aren't already a souls fan you should still definitely give it a try. And for those of you who don't like souls games you probably won't like it but it may have changed enough for you to give it a shot (though I doubt it). It's almost the same game as previous iterations, just a lot more focused. That means trimming down some areas to focus on others. Whether or not you think that is worth it will depends on what you look for in a game. The atmosphere and enemy design are by far the best out of the series so far, but the RPG elements did seem to take a hit at their expense. Overall it feels a bit more like an action-horror than an action-rpg."], ["TheBladeIsMe", "User", "10", "Its a very nice Game 10/10.

They were never loved on their initial release. They started to get love after a year and a half of dark souls. Personally i hate the trick weapons. At first i was amazed like everyone who has seen it for the first time. But the lack of weapon disappointed me. Also you are not able to dual wield any more(which was my favorit thing about demon/dark souls. Using moonlight butterfly spea on left and moonlight sword on right). After about 50 matches online every opponent feel the same due to the lack of weapon. if they put in about 20 more weapons and some different options for the off hand it would half solve the problem. And i personally dont understand whythey didnt put a twin blade/dual wield sword. Am i the only one who think that could have been an obviouse weapon to put in the game?

Having played from Demon's Souls to DS3 i thought that this game would be awesome, and it is, to some extent. The graphics are beautiful, the atmosphere is quite good and the gameplay is quite fast, however this is the biggest flaw in this game. The combat is more frenetic and everything is fast, except you. Your character is still a slug compared to other enemies or bosses that can in quick sucession attack you 4-5 times without leaving you space to roll or evade their attacks. Also, this game forces you to fight against multiple enemies the whole time, something that the much despised DS2 do all the time. It's annoying and cheap since you can only lock into one enemy at time, you can't use lock on and hope to attack everyone without any problem, you might get lucky but most of the time you'll end up dead quickly because all enemies in this game are ferocious. Also, your character is just a blind moron that misses his/her attack almost everytime unless you're using the lock on. So most of the time when you have to fight against mobs you'll end up hitting the air more than the enemies themselves. The bosses in this game are boring and yawn-inducing. Not even one of them are actually interesting, which is weird since From never had a lot of problems with boss design. The game also stripped down a lot of RPG elements from Dark Souls or Demon's Souls. Gone are the weight system, the poise and etc. You can still level up your char but you'll end up investing only in three attributes: Vitality, Endurance and Strength because the other attributes don't really make a lot of difference to your character's overall stats. You also have less armor, weapons and items overall, which is disappointing and it feels just a lazy job from FS. You pick one weapon and just keep with it until the end because it's not worth to change it. Of course that the Trick System adds a more interesting interaction with all weapons and also add some strategy to this game. There's also magic, which is called Arcane here, but i never used and as far as i'm concerned is really gimmicky and just ridiculous, it doesn't work like it works in DS or Demon's Souls. The game is quite short and the journey itself is quite forgettable. I'm sure that most people don't ever come back again to this game after finishing it once or twice because of the length of the campaign, the scarcity of weapons and armors and etc. You can't create dozens of different builds because of the attributes limitations. The only thing that you can change is your weapon, the rest is just unecessary unless you want a big challenge playing with an only-arcane build or only-firearm build or whatever...One thing that this game does quite well, though, it's killing you with cheap deaths. The sensation that i had while playing this game, specially at the last half of it, is the same feeling that i had while playing DS2, which is not a good thing. Simply put, the game starts quite hard but because the enemies are just too strong and the fact that BB forces you to use the \"parry\" attacks (here know as visceral attacks) makes the game harder and just an annoying festival of hit and miss attacks with wrong timed-shots happening almost  everytime. After a while you start to upgrade your weapon and the firearm becomes almost useless to a extent. But after halfway throught the game you'll start to see something changing: Enemy placement. It seemed that FromSoftware wanted to use the same strategy as Yui did and decided to just place a bunch of enemies everywhere just to kill you over and over again. You'll start to see how hard the game becomes out of nowhere. You'll be surrounded and destroyed by 2 or 3 attacks from 4 or 5 enemies at once. This is not an exaggeration. If you pay attention to the game you'll see that almost never you'll experience framerate drops, but at the end of the game this will start to happen almost the whole time, because of how much enemies the developers put into a single area, just pay attention and you'll see."], ["xvvolf4", "User", "6", "This was my first \"souls\" type game, and since I picked this up on sale I would say I got my money's worth...however I still have not finished the game because at around Rom, I just started to get bored and now I feel like playing the game has become a chore, rather than fun (which the entire first half was).

Once you understand better the mechanics of the game, how the storytelling works and how to cope withe the difficulty of the game, is really enjoyable. You will still die many times if this is your first playthrough, no doubt about that, but it does not feel too repetitive, since the playability is quite fluent and fun and, once you learn the movements of each NPC, quite straightforward.

Long story, but in the end i bought a PS4 just for this game and it was definetily worth all the money. This game looks good from the technical point of view. But the mystic cursed dark world this game offers is so much more. It's just a Masterpiece in the history of videogames. The fresh setting of the victorian London plus cursed Darkness creates the same deep Atmosphere like the other Souls-Games. Sound fits to the dark mood in this game. The Movement System is a bit faster than in Souls but also rewarding. Next Highlight, like in all Souls-Games,  are the bossfights. The Design of the Bosses is so wonderful and the mechanics are really diversified. The Playtime, especially with the really good DLC is, I would think around 50 hours for a first playthrough. The Game maybe is a bit frustrating to new players. You should have in mind that it's a part of the gamedesign that you will die. And you will often. To understand this helps a lot to perceive the uniqueness of the Soulsborne Games nowadays. They are different than most of the modern games. Also the storytelling is a point spoonfedded Blockbuster players will find ununsual or bad. Nearly all of the really deep and forked story is told just by descriptions of items you find and so there's much space for interpretation. Thousands of players are discussing the lore in forums, so you see it's not trivial or rudimentated. I know I compare this game very much to Dark or Demon's Souls, but it had to fulfill high expectations because of these highly rewarded games. I'm struggling to describe this unique Gametype to a person who didn't play a Souls-Game before. Get a PS4 and play this motherfukking piece of misanthropic art and make your own opinion like I did.

There was something about the Bloodborne atmosphere/look that made me pay attention. I bought the game in Feb 2016 & started playing shortly after. The first two hours was very confusing. The first several hours was soul crushing (my soul). Regardless, it was fun and I had bought The Old Hunters DLC with a discount code so i wasnt going to throw money away by giving up.

Its not gonna take the typical 20 to 60 minutes to figure out. After i had passed the first three bosses i began to get better and in-grove with the play-style. This point was roughly 10 hours into the game; i know it seems like a long time but that time frame isnt unreasonable. The game gives you no real direction or instruction. So as you discover (sometimes by accident which is perfectly fine), realize or look-up (dont do unless you're stuck for at least an hour otherwise you're cheating yourself) where to go, how to use an item whom to speak with or tactics in boss fights; these things are a natural gaming high you seldom find in any other game.

The art style is absolutely gorgeous; the character design is grotesque but beautiful and very innovative. Of course, there are some basic enemy archetypes (trolls, men with swords, etc.) but they are fuelled with the unforgiving difficulty. It's definitely a hard game, no argument there, but it's not difficult to the point where it's purely impossible. You will definitely see the \"You Died\" screen a lot but every time you see it, you'll be filled with just a little more knowledge and you will learn from your mistakes, and there are no drugs in the world that match the satisfaction from seeing the \"prey slaughtered\" screen after slaying a boss you've spent hours on. Also, the world design is so atmospheric; it's eerie and suspenseful and it will have you sweating bullets.

I can't say the camera angles have improved much in gaming as there are still weird angles making some boss battles more difficult than they should be.  I will say now that I will most likely not finish the game despite the great story and epic goth scenery.  I am giving it a 7 due to, no shock here, the inability to adjust difficulty.  You either live video games or you use them as brief escapes from an otherwise busy life.  If you have a job and a wife or girlfriend, you likely don't have time to devote to games like this as the difficulty level requires many many hours of gameplay in order to \"git gud\".  It is obviously the preference of the game designer, but I think the old school approach of having an easy mode that is truly easy is a way to make your game more accessible to the middle-age gamer that is limited on time.  I know I would love this game if I could just relax with it for an hour a day and get into the groovy graphics and storyline, but since that is not an option I feel that I can not truly enjoy the experience.  Like I said, the decision to add easy mode is up to the developer, however I would think From would want to sell as many copies as possible and I know many casual gamers who won't touch Souls or this due to the extreme difficulty.  I know fans of the game say that From is staying strong for not adding an easy mode, but is that really true?  If you want to get your booty kicked, then you will choose normal mode and let the booty-kicking begin.  At any rate, I love the game.  I watch videos of the gameplay just to enjoy the story and killer graphics.  however, a 7 is where I am parking the rating.

This game also features character creation, which is honestly sloppy and requires a YouTube tutorial on how to make a lesser monstrous playable character. (It's possible to make a super hot female or male character for those of you that are wondering) Lastly there is a level up system in which you can rank up through killing enemies and choose which stat to improve between Health, Endurance, or Special Skills (Strength, Dexterity, Arcane etc.) to become more powerful. The only downside to this game are the Chalice Dungeons. (Optional Grindfest) The story leaves a lot of un-answered questions but is rich in lore.

The other is that if you haven't played or heard of those games because you don't come on the internet much, or talk to people who pay attention to video games, you can still like this one as long as you have a tolerance for learning.  Another is for those who aren't into reading or those who like they're story/plot/whatever info dumped on them in a \"As you know...\" speech, than you probably won't like this game.

If your looking for a story that keeps you hooked you will find it here, however keep in mind that this is a FromSoftware game, you will actually have to look for the story and yes it is worth it. Game play is an important part of any game and it is perfect here. Every single button press, dodge, attack is all controlled by you, if you die, which you will a lot, its your fault. Its all on you to face new enemies, which have great variety, learn the enemies moves and adapt. Once again you will die a lot and after dying by a specific boss over and over and then defeating it is one of the best feelings in the world. The world is vibrant and filled with many different characters, which you can decide the fate for. Many sidelines can be completed and each offers a different take on what you do and how you do it. The world looks beautiful, especially when the fateful blood moon comes out. The game has a total of three endings, each completely different from one another. Their is also a great leveling up system with different attributes. Vitality for health, stamina for running time, skill for defense, attack and discovery, strength for attack power and speed, bloodtinge for gun damage and arcane for the different magic items you can find around the game. The game has a great variety of weapons each with their own combos and play styles and its fun to find new ones every singe time. The game has 13 bosses some optional, some not and many other bosses in chalice dungeons. Chalice dungeons are optional dungeons in which you make a chalice ritual which creates a dungeon which can be randomly generated or not. Three player coop is a big part of this game and is fun, every time you find a new area or fight and kill a boss, you obtain insight, using a beckoning bell can call upon random people or people with the same network password as you. Insight however also affect the game, after obtaining 10 insight the game gets harder and harder and harder so insight is a blessing yet also a curse.

The bosses are generally well designed with a variety of types and sizes. The world itself feels alive in no small part due to the level of connectivity between areas. The game looks absolutely beautiful, from the Gothic castle, to the lake , woods and more. Now there are some issues that must me mentioned, the pre-patch load times show a lack of polish, there is a smaller weapon and location variety as compared to dark souls and the story is kept in the background. Some of these are more disclaimers for new comers, the lack of variety contributes to a streamline approach (not the same as dumbing down). The story is lovingly crafted (get it) and the world is genuinely a delight to explore.

Im writing this review very late I know, but I wanted to take this year and really drink in the whole game and play through it multiple times to give anybody who reads this a fair and honest review on what this game is like.

The game will feel overwhelming but believe me when I say this if you stay and persevere, you will see the difference in your playing ability and reflexes once you reach even the half way mark.  You will see the accomplishments and feel successful, which is something almost no other game in todays market can give you.  The enemies are some of the most disturbed, brilliant, and violently mutated creatures imaginable. The weapons all feel different and each have there own strength and weaknesses.

Do these games take patience? Yes. The thing people don't understand is, that the patience is learned through playing the game and you don't even realize your getting it.

The world feels alive and actually interconnected.  Then there's the story, I wont go into detail for spoiler reasons, but come on people what happened to imagination and actually working for our stories instead of hand holding.  Bottom line is there is a very deep and rich lore in this game and if you take the little bit of time to read the items and be observant, believe me you will see the story and all the characters that are unfortunate enough to be stuck in the world with you unfold.  I will go back to my statement about this game being a sword.  Just look at like this. the fluid and almost dancing combat is the point of the sword. The creatures, music, and weapons are the balanced blade. Then the world itself and the lore in it is sturdy handle.

Don't just automatically assume any game with critical acclaim is a quality title. I write this review as I lost 2 hours worth or \"Blood Echoes\" after already becoming sick of the game from the 3 hours worth of \"Blood Echoes\" I lost the last time I played. The game isn't like a good RPG where you gain experience at a decent pace and have realistic opportunities to save your progress. No instead you are constantly tensed up fighting enemies that give you virtually no experience to work with which you can instantly lose because the enemy difficulty level is ridiculously unforgiving. I've played video games for over 15 years and usually a game with an unbalanced difficulty level and unfair challenge is regarded as a failure. It isn't fun to spawn, walk 20 steps, encounter a group of eneimes you can barely beat if you tease their aggression radius, then walk 20 more steps to die to an enemy ambush you could never have predicted, then spawn again in a panicked attempt to get all the levels you grinded for, and die again without ever recovering them. Why is it then that the Bloodborne and Dark Souls series gets a pass when no other game does? That's not to say its all bad, as the combat is uniquely satisfying when you can actually stand a chance. Its really the only thing that kept me coming back to give the game a second chance. But then I'd instantly remember why I couldn't stand the game again, because I'd walk the same 20 steps I'd walked 10 times over and die again. I'm sure there is something I'm missing that might make the game more enjoyable, but if there is its too cryptic for me to find and thus again would be bad game design. I get that a game needs a challenge to be fun, and I'm sure for many Bloodborne is the pinnacle of a good challenge they have been waiting for. But if you are like me and only have so much time to devote to gaming each day and prefer games that you can actually progress in, you will probably just feel frustrated and cheated out of the money you spent. However if you enjoy walking down the same corridor 10 different times doing the same thing till you get lucky and progress, Bloodborne is perfect for you."], ["vega17", "User", "10", "ssaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"], ["mybrainhurts", "User", "10", "45-year-old gamer here who has never played a Souls game.

I'm a very big fan of the souls game and Dark Souls is one of my favourite games of all time, but Bloodborne, it suprised me. In this review I'm not really gonna talk about the story or anything allthough it has a more to your face story than Dark Souls, I'm gonna talk about one feature in preticular: the shields. Now in the Souls franshise shields have taken a really important role and it seemed pretty much essential, but it wasn't. Now this genre of gaming is not really appreciated by everybody, but BloodBorne was and I'm gonna explain why. There is two ways to play the souls games: The defensive way and the aggressive way. The aggressive way is the way to go either you're good at the game or not and I can say that as a long time fan. when someone recommends to their friend to play Dark Souls, they always recommend the defensive way wich is very repetitive and boring, so that person does not like the game any more after they played over an hour or two. That's why the aggressive way is better, it has more risk. If you play the defensive way, you're allways gonna use a shield.

In the pre sequel however they decide to tell you (in more detail) about his uprising and how he became Handsome Jack. This seems to be a good idea, the problem is several plot holes or unclear 'things', you see (spoilers) Angel back in Borderlands 1 was an ai but in Borderlands 2 it comes out that she's actually a Siren and Jack's daughter, and in a echo recording he's still Handsome Jack (not Jack, there's a difference) and pulling the strings of everything yet it turns out (according to the pre-sequel) Jack turned into Handsome Jack AFTER the events of Borderlands 1 but the recording indicated this was before Borderlands 1 even with someone telling Jack to put his mask back on, confused?

In truth, BBF is about an 8.5, but even placing a number on the review is difficult for a few reasons.  The game is awkward, in much the same way as Mars War Logs felt awkward.  From inconsistent characterization and uncomfortably cynical dialogue to bad lip-syncing and amateurish voice acting, the presentation is going to rub a lot of players the wrong way.  The question is, how much importance do you place on cinematic presentation?  Because if you're the type of gamer who enjoys gritty real-time combat and a serious level of challenge, BBF may still have enough to offer that aesthetics don't matter anymore.  If you like, say, Dark Souls or The Witcher for their strategic and deliberately-paced combat systems, you will want to give BBF a spin.  If you thought Dragon's Dogma was a good first entry into a new IP in spite of some glaring flaws, you'll easily overlook the worst of BBF's issues.  Just don't expect Skyrim.  While you could compare chunks of BBF to a lot of its action RPG peers, it holds the least resemblance to Elder Scrolls.  There's some DNA from Dragon Age, Witcher, Amalur, Dark Souls, Fable, even War in the North, and of course Mars War Logs -- but practically nothing about the game suggests that Spiders was trying to compete with Skyrim.  As long as you set your expectations accordingly, you'll be just fine, especially considering it's only a $50 new release on a brand new console, on which there is very little selection right now and NO other RPGs to speak of.  BBF actually manages to deliver on much of its gameplay mechanics, and I genuinely enjoy the music and art style.  Crafting is deeper than expected for both equipment and expendables, as you can change out modular parts of weapons and armor easily or craft items like traps on the fly, even in the heat of combat.  Mission objectives and combat conditions are varied and often very fun to figure out, even if you die a lot in the process.  Things like target lock-on and parrying work just fine (contrary to popular belief), but heaven forbid, you actually need to learn the game's system to be effective with them.  I appreciate that this isn't a paint-by-numbers RPG, and even though it borrows some inspiration from plenty of big-name IPs, the resulting whole feels almost entirely original.  It just won't be the kind of original that everybody likes.  Personally, I'm getting everything out of it that I expected and maybe then some, so I respect what Spiders did with their first retail game.  I look forward to seeing what they do next, and I wouldn't mind getting some DLC for Bound By Flame.

This is difficulty done right, to progress through a battle, even with minor enemies you need to be on your toes.

The story is cliche but it's enjoyable none the less.  I've managed to stay human even though I've made a lot of immoral decisions at other points in the game.  It's deeper than people are making it out to be with a mass effect like dialogue/morality system.  The character customization is in the middle of the road.  Upon creating your character there are only 4 or 5 choices for male/female along with some hairstyles.  The gear is fun, allowing you to switch helmuts, gloves, breast-plate, etc.  although in the end there are only maybe 7 of each with about 30 total weapon choices.  You can collect materials to add both visual and statistical bonuses to them which is fun.  The visuals have a cool slightly cell-shaded look that resembles some of borderlands town textures with an eos4 vibe.

A smoother combat system would have done wonders for this game.  In the end, it just wasn't my cup of tea.  If I'm going to have to be strategic my combat, I at least want some reward (ala Dark Souls/Dark Souls 2), not just another muddled conversation/quest waiting for me at the end.  I also find it extremely funny that people are posting reviews after only playing for 2-3 hours.  You can hardly learn a game in that amount of time. I personally only trust reviews from people who put in 8-10 hours because they get past the first town.  I completed Bound by Flame in approximately 18 hours.

I think I know why people are rating it so unfairly, and reviewers aren't giving it a decent score, to begin with the game is really really hard. You die over and over again in fights with one or two enemies and you're slow and weak. There are no potions dropped, your magic does nothing and it seems like the game is impossible. People have been spoiled by RPGs which make sure you never hardly die and always feel powerful. This isn't skyrim where there enemies are levelled and you only fight rats for the first few hours, this game drops you straight into tough fights, and you have to block constantly! No button mashing. But once you get the hang of it it's great, really satisfying to fight enemies and make a strategy, craft potions and upgrades to your armour and choose a strategy from your possible skills. I have made a sort of fire mage warrior, I regenerate health and mana while guarding and blow up my enemies from a distance. At the beginning tho with no health  or mana regen it was hard, every single fight I would die, now it's still tough but I survive. You get a good sense of progression, strategy and development. Also the characters are really good and believable, the dialogue is great, what I've had of the story so far has been funny and exciting, I'm really looking forward to the rest of the game. This game is a lot like the Witcher 1, good atmosphere, believable story, and strategy to combat. This game is supposed to be hard to begin with! It's not fable!

The crafting is kind of awkward too, taking sometimes exorbitant amounts of a certain ingredient that is hard to get. The dialogue, I would say is a tad shaky and there tries to be jokes from some character where it should be the last thing on their minds. The negative aside, I do give it props for, in the beginning, being able to throw me off with plot twists. However, those props don't counter the negatives I experience. There really wasn't much in the way of making a character, only 5 or 6 options for the hair and facial hair each.

Brutal and loud, BUTCHER makes for a suitable companion to last year's excellent DOOM reboot."], ["God is a Geek", "Critic", "80", "Butcher is a triumphant ode to id Software\u2019s classic shooters, but still forges its own path. Just be careful not to slip on all the blood it spills."], ["COGconnected", "Critic", "78", "It does a lot of things right, but still feels like the sum of its parts don\u2019t quite add up. When it comes down to it your enjoyment of Butcher will directly correlate to how quick and nasty you like your games. But if quick n\u2019 nasty sounds good to you, you\u2019re in for it, because Butcher is awfully quick and wonderfully nasty."], ["Impulsegamer", "Critic", "76", "With gleefully chaotic viscera-soaked combat and an arsenal at hand that\u2019d make Rambo weep, Butcher is a bombastic throwback to the games of old that perfectly nails its core objective."], ["Playstation Official Magazine UK", "Critic", "70", "Butcher revels in its ever-increasing difficulty. [July 2016, p.84]"], ["Vandal", "Critic", "70", "This is a game for 2D shooters fans, even though we can't help but feel it is an unpolished gem that could have been so much more."], ["SpazioGames", "Critic", "70", "BUTCHER doesn't innovate the videogame market, but it's fun and should be enjoyed by gamers who are searching for a nice challenge."], ["Video Chums", "Critic", "69", "Butcher is a fun, addictive riff on a classic genre with an uncompromising approach that makes it feel both rewarding and frustrating. You're unlikely to get much mileage out of it unless you like a lot of repetition and a torturous level of challenge but if you're attracted by its over-the-top retro aesthetic, it's definitely worth checking out."], ["DarkStation", "Critic", "60", "While you're making your way through its main story on the default difficulty, Butcher is great. In addition to thoughtful, satisfying gameplay, the whole thing just gives off this impeccable sense of attitude. But when you try out the higher difficulties, its control layout becomes its Achilles' heel. If we look at the game as a whole, it's a combination of high quality and wasted potential. If we only include the stuff that's worth playing, there just isn't enough of it. Either way, Butcher is a middling experience bolstered somewhat by its sense of character."], ["TheSixthAxis", "Critic", "60", "Butcher is a game that will mainly appeal to those who like hardcore shooters, where one wrong move can cost you progress. For others, that style of play could prove frustrating, especially when testing your platforming skills. Though it\u2019s built around the idea of being a relentless killing machine, that doesn\u2019t really feel fully realised with most enemies on a par with you when it comes to dealing damage. Butcher shows potential, but it doesn\u2019t reach it in its short campaign."], ["GameSpew", "Critic", "60", "This grim, pixellated gorefest successfully channels the spirit of 8 and 16 bit shoot-\u2019em-ups but doesn\u2019t stand up to sustained play; spend too long with Butcher in one sitting and it starts feeling like an infuriating grind."], ["Digitally Downloaded", "Critic", "60", "The level design is generally good, albeit quite generic. It\u2019s not like Butcher has many surprises for the players, but the action flows nicely and the game knows how to be punishing without feeling unfair. All in all, it's a generally smooth game let down by its idea of scale."], ["PlayStation Country", "Critic", "60", "BUTCHER pays a visceral tribute to DOOM on a 2D plane. The gameplay can be a bit shallow, the difficulty can result in repetition, but if you enjoy the speed run scene then this could have some legs."], ["Mistwalker_94", "User", "10", "Wtf?! Are people retarded? Why is this game not given more attention, it is so frickin' awesome! It's a gritty ultra voilent 2d sidescrolling shooter inspired by Doom & Quake. It is fast gory has a really cool ( but super pixelated ) art style, the guns are so cool they thunder like howitzers and ALWAYS turn enemies to puddles of bloody gore! Music is cool dark industrial kind of grinding and pounding ( a bit hard to explain) I bought this game because it was cheap, I had seen the mixed reviews so I didn't expect much but DAMN this game is good! It is short though, I got through it in an hour but since it was so cheap and because of replay value I think it was worth it. Buy the game it's awesome!"]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "Switch", "Xbox One"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/d3d3bce5d33bebe5f139f8ce3d1252a0.jpg"}
