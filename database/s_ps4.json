The Presentation is bad. I think on PC it must be good because I've seen good images from this game. I'm playing it on PS4 Pro on a 4k tv and it looks bad.  So much pixel popping.  Almost a frame rate jutter, or perhaps a locked frame rate that's too low.  The exact opposite of smooth anything, especially between battles.  Many fundamental assets like grass and structures are simply bad looking from a mix of asset resolution, lack of post processing maybe, and abundant aliasing problems.  This looks like it would run fine on the Nintendo Switch, but the PS4 is worlds above that kind of thing.  The other problem I had was the flow/fun factor.  It's like they said \"lets use only our existing assets and concepts and formats, and insert into that something to simulate another type of game, but without actually adding any of the gaming elements that those other games require.\"  Another way to say that is there are simply roadblocks in your way from enjoying the fun gaming experience they created long ago and have endlessly refined.  They convolute it with these \"other game simulations\" that don't actually innovate or change the actual game material.  Imagine playing God of War but only with Crash Bandicoot and only with his move set. It's would be goofy and stupid.  They would have to rework everything and give crash an all new move set, new animations, maybe new engine, maybe new...everything.  Well this game is a lot like that only less goofy.

The budget was small, especially for a new company, and they still managed to get the original sound produced from the classic game to compose music on this new version of the game.

The sound design is pretty ok, nothing really stands out though. The combat is nice mixing swordplay with guns and different upgrades and abilities you give Lo Wang. Which brings me to the upgrades and powers. You can upgrade your guns and sword and abilities with in-game currency, karma points for getting new skills, and Ki crystals for getting new powers. So it has RPG elements too. Good news for classic FPS players: health packs instead of regenerating health. The enemy AI for the most part is ok. Sometimes taking cover, other times running head-on at you. The different environments look good but none of them really stood out and made me say \"I like this level\" except for maybe 2 or 3 of them.

OK here's the problem. The shack the man was killed in? It's so small you can't get 20 feet away to hurl a harpoon. What makes Holmes so sure the guy wasn't run through with it like a bayonet, a method enabling an ordinary man to put much more strength into it since he'd lever let go of the harpoon? That's the more logical conclusion to draw from the crime scene. But Holmes is now certain a man of only ordinary strength could not have done this.

Recommendation: at the end of each case, don't check to see if you're correct or not; just let the game let you think you got it right; better to fool yourself than to open yourself up for the developer to say, \"Nah, we thought THIS explanation was more plausible, even though all conclusions are viable.\""], ["CenkAlp", "User", "6", "Hikaye = 7"]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "Xbox One"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/ea6a267aac2d925564f139ab85265f71.jpg"}

With interesting lore (real lore) , new gods every month, and new patches every 2 weeks, you'll be hooked into it. Each god is different and there are many different playstyles (especially because of the items you can build). Although smite is completely FreeToPlay, there are cosmetic items that can make the game a bit more fun. Some are purchased with favor (earned through playing ) or gems (earned through login bonuses, gem events, and real money). There is an Ultimate God Pack that gets you every current and future god for $30, ($20 and even $15 in sales).  Make sure to completely learn what to do in each game mode (especially conquest), because each player in the main mode (conquest) has roles to fulfill.

Gameplay and interface are very smooth, intuitive and easy to learn. The mission areas are really big and very very nicely designed!

When sonic mania came out people eminently gave it extremely positive points. During that time forces was getting gameplay footage of modern, classic and avatar stages and many people were feeling less excited about this game. When the game came out November of this year, many mixed reviews were spread across the internet for it's lack of being a sequel to colors and generations, in fact go play those titles because this game feels like it's just beginning. let me explain this game has 30 levels total which sounds like a big game but these levels are way too short and acquires very little input from the player. Modern sonic comes back with the boost gameplay that we all know and adore but because of these at least 1 minute levels you wish that there was more to it, the levels do have multiple pathways but it isn't as explorative as colors or generations. Classic stages are just there, I don't really care if classic sonic is in this game but it makes it feel like a completely missed opportunity to have classic sonic mean something in this game and because of classic sonic not having any sense to this plot, his levels just don't have a lot of effort placed in, his levels can be fun if they weren't dull and you can looked passed it but by the end of the day, what was the point of bringing him in this game?. The avatar is probably the best part of the game, you can create your own original sonic character in the changing room mode thingy and it's pretty fun to mess around what you want it to be and look like, not only that but you can play as it in this game how cool is that, the custom character is like modern sonic but with out the boost button, returning from colors are the wisps (they don't explain why they are here but what ever) your custom hero can equip many guns called wispons that gives you the power of wisps adding a bit to the replay value... depending on the type of gun you use, your custom hero can only equip one wispon and you can change it but what ever gun you choose to use and the level you walk into you can see that their are other pathways that you can get to using other wisps but because you only have one wispon to use in the level you wish you could explore the other pathways but to do that you need to exit out of the level, get the wispon you want to use, and get back in the level and try to find the pathway you want to go on, because of this setup you are limited to the wispon you are using and having to exit to get the gun you wish to use in that level (it's kind of hard to explain honestly). these gameplay styles CAN be enjoyable, but the levels are too short, too straight forward and are easy to blow through, the games controls can be a bit finicky, controlling modern sonic while boosting feels awesome, but when stopping to do platforming his jump feels very awkward and unnatural and it doesn't help that their acceleration starts off slow and runs very fast feeling slippery especially around small platforms. Forces is......disgustingly short and sloppy, for example sonic goes to chemical plant leaves someone else goes to chemical plant and leaves, modern sonic gets saved by the avatar in the death egg and leaves but classic sonic goes to the death egg and leaves. In the end I think your money is miles better spent on sonic mania go play that instead of this short stuff, play unleashed, heroes, adventure 1 or 2, colors, generations, heck play lost world to kill some time. Forces isn't bad it's fine but I don't think it's worth your time, if your looking for a sonic game with the colors and generations gameplay and don't care how short the levels are and the bland plot then this is something you might enjoy."], ["thiago52192", "User", "10", "Sonic Forces mixes everything great about Generations and Colors and still manged to get back to good things of the Adventure era, such as vocal and remixed ost, dark story, and Eggman being a good villain.

You are able to speed through levels as Modern Sonic, speed through 2D levels as Classic Sonic and use weapons as your customizable avatar. The game is a mixture of 2D and 3D. It is much more balanced unlike Colours. There are even fully 3D. Speaking of 3D levels, there are also tag team stages. It plays like Heroes, but with Sonic and your avatar. They are fully 3D meaning that you aren't running into 2D sections. These are possible some of the best parts of the game. As for the story, Eggman has used the Phantom Ruby - from Sonic Mania - to takeover the world. Old villains from the past return and there is also a new villain - Infinite - who is brought into the game great. Sonic gets kidnapped and Tails goes missing meaning that the characters create the Resistance to fight against Eggman. Knuckles is the leader. The custom hero joins too and so do other characters. Anyways, the game controls well. Classic Sonic controls like he did in Generations, but with the dropdash from Sonic Mania. Modern Sonic is improved from other Modern games. The avatar controls alright. His jump is not great for platforming and the distance of the jump depends on how fast you were running. This is where platforming can be difficult. Another problem is that Sonic is too fast to be in smaller levels. This makes the game insanely short and you can complete the main story in about 2 hours 30 minutes.

Despite having a few flaws, the developers of Sonic Mania made one of the most consistent experiences of this year. The creativity and originality in the visuals is awe-inspiring, and I loved how animated and beautiful each of the levels were. Every single one had an original premise, with the only one I didn\u2019t like being Hydrocity. No path took advantage of the great pacing mechanics, it was either fast or slow, with very few moments that crossed over. The rest of the game, however, worked extremely well. Every path demonstrated how well the levels were designed, and the branching paths gave the game a great sense of exploration with the rewards being completely worthwhile. Despite the speed sometimes launching Sonic into hazards that were unavoidable, the game is a remarkably controlled and thought out. Through pacing the speed, the developers show immense confidence in how their levels are designed, and rightfully so. Every level has unique mechanics and feels distinct and memorable. Akin to the classic Sonic games, they force Sonic to go slow and build up to speed. They make the player earn the speed they gain, which is infinitely more rewarding than being forced to go a certain speed like in the more modern games. Each level feels connected to the last, as certain levels use neglected mechanics from previous levels, and the end result is a game that feels cohesive and very smooth in terms of difficulty. On the other hand, a few bosses were frustrating and there were a few moments that I felt were unfair, often due to the speed throwing Sonic into unavoidable obstacles, which contradicted the otherwise extremely well-paced difficulty curve and brilliant level layout of the game, however as said previously they didn't ever frustrate me to the point of wanting to stop playing.

With other titles like destiny and call of duty on the market i feel like dice/ea are relying heavily on the star wars hype to sell titles instead of a deep immersive game.

So I am going to start with the good parts of Battlefront. The graphics are great the soundtrack is also great. Dice also managed to somehow capture the magic of Star Wars. From the dogfights with X-Wings and Tie Fighters down to how detailed and awesome Endor looks and feels. Endor looks amazing and is probably the best Star Wars map I have seen to date. You can really see how much effort EA put into some of the bigger maps such as Endor and Hoth. Now if only they would've done so with the rest of this game. The biggest problem with Battlefront is that this entire game feels rushed. Only 4 planets and 12 maps at launch is a huge disappointment. The worst part about this is that they have already confirmed 16 maps for the season pass. More maps as DLC than in the main game? That's low even for EA. Most of the maps aside from Hoth and Endor feel rushed and plain. The ice caves and the sand dunes all feel the same. They feel as if they were sloppily put together with little or no effort. Most of modes are pretty boring and average. You have your 20v20 modes such as Supremacy and Walker assault which are pretty much the only modes people are going to be playing. I had the opportunity to play Walker assault during the beta and to my surprise it was actually pretty fun. It wasn't perfect but I had a blast with it. Sadly EA has decided to change and dumb down most of the mode probably because of casuals complaining about how it was too hard for rebels to win or something. So a mode that use to take cooperation and effort to win (as the Rebels for the most part) has been dumbed down so much that you could probably be shooting into the sky and still win as the rebels. The weapons also feel dumbed down in both range and damage. Another part of this game I was really excited for was the Fighter Squadron mode. Granted it was no space battles but it looked really fun from the trailer. Sadly EA decided to go and make it 20v20 but with a catch. 10 real people on each team and 10 AI on each team. What the hell??? So half of the time you would be killing AI instead of people. Killing ships are also extremely easy it takes zero skill or effort. I managed to go on a 20 killsteak from just holding down L2 and shooting blindly. They have also decided to include heroes into the mix. You have 2 heroes you can play as, The Millennium Falcon or Slave 1. The biggest problem with the heroes is that they're too op. Now I know what your thinking the heroes are suppose to be op that's what makes them fun. But I have literally spent matches where I am behind Slave 1 the whole time shooting and firing missles only to do less than half damage. It's practically impossible to kill these heroes unless your entire team is on their ass. The biggest problem with Battlefront is the lack of content. Within 5 hours of this game I had already played everything in it! In the end Battlefront is a average game that was sloppily put together and rushed out to market by EA. However that's not to say that it's a awful game. I still managed to have some fun running around as Boba Fett or Han Solo shooting people. Dice has managed to really capture Star Wars perfectly in some aspects of the game (such as sound design, visuals, vehicles, music, etc) and you can really see what parts of the game that they really worked hard on and those parts are the best part of this game.

Keep in mind that I am a great pilot in Battlefield and am a very experienced shooter player, so it's not coming from an inept casual player that is sad he can't cut it.  I expect more from DICE and EA since Battlefield is fairly deep (and now includes a single player mode, even if it's just okay in terms of quality).  Visiting the battlefields of the Star Wars universe and hearing the wonderful Star Wars soundtrack in the background are the best treats to have, but everything else about Battlefront is half-baked.  The DLC is $50 in season-pass form and stands as DICE's opportunity to improve this game.  Some might enjoy this game, so don't completely throw it out as a possible must-have game for you, but unless decent graphics, a soundtrack and nostalgia are enough to satisfy you, your $60 is better spent on other great games (Fallout 4 is a good buy in lieu of Battlefront, or even Black Ops 3 - I can't believe I'm recommending a CoD game over Battlefront)."], ["vreynauld", "User", "3", "Graphically beautiful.

The graphics are amazing, the Star Wars aura is great, but other than that it feels hollow. Without a doubt, the fact that they released this game without a campaign was a very poor decision.

The graphics are top notch, for once I feel like I'm actually inside a Star Wars film, the maps are practically replicas of the sets from the original films. Content wise, this is where most seem to be disappointed, it is definitely lacking as of launch. From a consumers stand point, this is unacceptable, from the Devs standpoint, they were pushed to release this before the new film releases so most of the time was put to authenticity. Dice promise lots of free support on top of the atrociously priced DLC season pass, which starts in early Decemeber. The modes are mostly fun but are typical shooter fare, minus one called Hero Hunt which is all based on cheap tactics and luck to win, but the true catch here are the two larger scale modes. These are Walker Assault and Supremacy. Walker Assault pits Rebels against Imperials with heavy artillery within a time limit to destroy all Imperial AT-AT's or have their base destroyed resulting in loss. Supremacy is very much Battlefields classic conquest mode with a catch, instead of losing respawn tickets both teams are fighting over capturing all the control points, being whoever has them all by the end or who has the most wins. Overall I see this as a very niche game, it will appeal mostly to Star Wars fans and casual shooter players like myself (I tend to pop in an online shooter for maybe a couple hours once or twice a week). This game most likely won't appeal to the COD or Halo fan, even Battlefield fans and this is a game developed by DICE, all because it lacks depth or realism. The game is very arcadey and doesn't hold hundered of levels worth of in game unlocks as of launch. This is a game you pick up and play every once in awhile, it is not the kind of game you'll throw 100's hours online into a game like in Battlefield. But with DICE's promise of free post launch update content I have hope for this game to become something much better. As of now I can't go higher than a 6/10, although I'm enjoying the game I can't justify the lack of content at launch for $60. Maybe in a few months it will be worth it.

Hardcore gamers will find satisfaction in the custom character loadouts and character progression rewards and unlockables.

Just like once upon a time when in multi-player gaming when it didn't matter if you could get a head shot no scope, it was just about having a fun experience in a world many of us love and grew up with. Enjoy it for what it is, take control of the hero's & vilians you love, take to the skies in epic dogfights in ships that you use to imagine piloting growing up. I recommend this game to any Star Wars fan even non Star Wars fan (if they're out there).

The game itself will have four expansions coming to it, and one could even say the development of the game is still early. I mean, just look at Destiny (the video game). When it was released, it sold well (because of the marketing) but the game itself was in many people's opinions (including mine) more of a flop. A year later however, more people bought the expansion to the game (than when the game was first released) because the game's developers literally redefined the game, almost improving on every aspect.

Plus, you can just mute it if you don't like it - the sound effects are good enough alone), and pointless game modes that are too similar to Battlefield and other shooters. That statement is highly opinionated and is sad to hear pro critics saying things like this. Besides, did you know that Battlefront started off as a Battlefield mod? Yes, in Battlefield 1942 there was a Star Wars mod and that's where game developers got the idea for Battlefront. If you don't believe me, you can do some research.

If you are on the fence about this game this review is for you. First of all the graphics and sound design are phenomenal(playing on PS4). EA has absolutely nailed the Star Wars universe here. The dense forests of Endor, the snow covered hills and valleys of Hoth have been painstakingly recreated to perfection. You are transported to a galaxy far far away like never before. In terms of game play, its very solid. It is not quite as hardcore as Call of Duty or Halo and leans more toward an arcade experience but the same gun handling skills that rack up kills in CoD and other major shooters will work here as well. Those claiming that this is Battlefield with a Star Wars skin are way off base. Naturally there are similarities since both games share the same developer but as a long time Battlefield vet I can tell you that this is a different animal. There is a wealth of modes here and while some are better than others the sheer amount of options is very welcome. I suspect most people will gravitate toward Walker Assault and Supremacy. These are both big team battle modes which focus on controlling specific areas of the map. If you are interested in a slightly more intimate experience there are plenty of modes which offer smaller player counts and cozier maps. However, the force is not entirely strong with this one as it could be and I do have a few gripes with the title. Respawns can be a bit problematic. I have spawned in the middle of an enemy battalion countless times. Some of the gun play can be erratic at times. In some instances a few laser bolts will put an enemy down for good while other times two dozen will have no effect. This does not happen very often and these could be connection issues or something that could be addressed with a patch but it is worth pointing out. My other issue with the game is that lack of maps at launch. The game ships with 4 planets and while they are all rendered beautifully and a blast to play a larger variety would have been most welcome. With all of that said this game is an absolute blast. Controls feel great and there is enough mode variety here to keep you busy for a long time. I do wish there was a dedicated campaign included but the multiplayer is so well designed that I can overlook the omission. I do want to point out that Star Wars fans will get a little more out of the title than non fans due to the fantastic sense of place which Dice has created here. There are plenty of Easter eggs throughout the maps that will tickle your nostalgia and put a big smile on your face. This game was made to allow players to relive their Star Wars fantasies and while there is still plenty here for shooter fans with no interest in the Star Wars universe, fans will get the most bang for their buck. I\u2019m having an absolute blast. I hope that folks interested in the title give it a try and not be turned away from a great gaming experience by all the hate and misspelled reviews from people who have not even played this title.

Also, people say that the flying parts of the game are terrible, I have to admit, they are not fantastic but they are good.

With that said, this game has amazing sound, spot on visuals, and while the gameplay is rather average and \"point & shoot\" simple, it still manages to be fun most of the time and though I stated it is \"point & shoot\" simple, it still takes a level of skill and quickness to get kills consistently opposed to other fps's. Vehicle use is disappointing, as previous battlefront and even battlefield games you had to first learn how to fly under control before learning how to dogfight, this game it's far too easy to control vehicles and getting kills in vehicles is far too easy and less skillful. Not every game mode is great but it's still fun (though having no galactic conquest is downright confusing). And in defense of this game having no campaign, they warned us consumers about that, so if you buy this unaware of no campaign and it being online only.. then my guess is you're mentally lacking and you need to do your research before dropping $60+ dollars on a game. Anyway I give this game an 8 for reasons that the sound and graphics are amazing, the ability to play as star wars heroes is cool, and while gameplay is simplistic and is more of a \"point & shoot\" fps, it still takes much more skill and quickness to get kills consistently than other fps's... i.e. Call of Duty!

Gameplay is fun but really basic which I understand, because they are just trying to make the game fun for everyone, but it just makes it way easier for skilled players to completely dominate on the battlefield. The Heroes and Viliains are not very fun to play as, other than Boba Fett. Lots of modes, but it really just boils down to shooting people, other than the Fighter Squadron and Heroes vs Villains modes. The way vehicles are handled in this game is not good. You can only get vehicles if you find power-ups on the battlefield. There is a much better way to do this, but EA was afraid of ripping stuff from other series like Battlefield. If they would have taken the essentials from other games and just added in Star Wars things, the game would be a lot better. Graphics are great as usual from DICE. Sound and atmosphere are spot on. Even though I have many problems with this game, I still enjoyed playing it. The lack of content disappoints me, and I'm sure as hell not buying the Season Pass, but I'm looking forward to the sequel so that DICE and EA can fix some of these problems, and add in a Campaign, and Clone Wars stuff(and Sequel trilogy content).

Not here, it's a just a chaotic shooter with Star wars sounds. We played the open beta thinking this was a taste of a much larger game. No, that was it. We all paid A grade price for one third of a game. The weapons are not configurable, you cannot form squads. There is nothing to do with space in this edition of Battlefront.

You can play as a hero, which is extremely over-weighted in the game, and have seen players get 96-0 K/D which doesn't sound like balanced game play to me. All the guns shoot very similar and in most cases can behave like sniper rifles but with different damage ratings at longer ranges. What's most offensive is that EA expect you to pay for a season pass that is the same price of a whole new game and all we get are duplicated maps, and no new mechanics.

But this is only the paint job that hides a very shallow FPS: 1. All Weapons feel like they do the same amount of damage, even with the automatic blasters they feel more accurate than what the stats has you believe. Even Han Solo's blaster is the best weapon unlocked at the last stage of the game, and it's the most overpowered weapon in the game, with stats that remind me of the FAMAS from Black Ops 1. 2. Vehicles are few in number and are sometimes useless, ships are useless on some maps, and you could do more kamikazes in these ships than actually trying to shoot enemies. 3. Most of the cards are overlooked in favor for only a few cards such as the jump pack and grenades. 4. Heroes and Villains are way too overpowered, and unlike the last two games, there is no limit for how long you can play them, so until death you can go on crazy kill streaks and there is no satisfaction of earning these pick ups, unless you happen to be the last person that hit them and collect the hero drop. 5. There is only a few modes that are fun like Walker Assault and Supremacy. The rest are generic and not worth your time if you're a fan of Battlefront like I am. 6. No story mode, but plenty of disappointing cut scenes in survival that reminds me of what the story could've been. 7. Customization is shallow and a huge disappointment. 8. And the final nail in this coffin of a game is the price severely out-weighs the benefits, making it a much better rental than an awesome purchase.

That being said, I'm not a big fan of this game. Cons: The game just doesn't play like it should. Whether it be the inability to scale a rock that is smaller than your shoe or the total lack of response from weapons. On top of these smaller factors are the much larger factors such as the price tag in total ($110 for game and season pass), the awful updates that try to \"fix\" what wasn't broken in the game to make it a level playing field, and that major lack of content. Battlefront 1 and 2 were jam packed full of content with multiplayer, galactic conquest, and CAMPAIGN (which for some reason isn't important anymore). First, this up in prices isn't just for Star Wars Battlefront, but still. I don't want to pay 60-70$ for a game only to have the DLC season pass (all of the items that were originally on there that were just held back) come out shortly after for another $50. Had it been 20$ it may not have been as big of an ordeal. Secondly, these updates really need to quit trying to level the game out. There is no point in allowing level progression if you're going to nerf all of the stronger weapons and buff all of the weaker ones, just make a linear game with one a full-auto, semi-auto, and burst gun at that point. Lastly, the biggest surprise to me was the upsetting fact that EA felt in their hearts (assuming they have them) that campaign is for chumps and Star Wars (a franchise known for its stories) didn't need an actual campaign to appeal to gamers. That is about as smart as reading instructions telling you to not put your hand in a blender and then putting it in there anyway and slamming down the pulse button. These lackluster, repetitive \"missions\" are a joke, its just training AI with buffed reaction time. If EA makes a sequel to this game (which I really hope they do and do it right) then there needs to be a campaign, better weapons/ versatility, and perhaps a lower price tag (ha). Oh, and if you're going to charge $110 for a star wars game, the gamers should at least get every single Star Wars and not just the OT (even if you hate the prequels)."], ["MercenaryofHate", "User", "5", "Battlefront looks and sounds amazing! weapon variation as well as AI models are done well. The two-camera modes first-person and third-person have no issues and switching between them is easy but as Battlefront shows us looks aren't everything. The problem with Battlefront isn't on a technical level it plays and runs fine but other problems contribute to it's downfall. Battlefront simply doesn't offer the player enough content to work with and all though single-player elements were thrown into the game there isn't enough diversity in missions or customization for matches in fact there is no customization outside of gun and perks; This is a big issue for me I would expect to edit the game maybe my character add some more AI for a huge battle!

Next the modes range from multiplayer/single player but Battlefront thinks to small it feels more like a Battlefield re-skin or mod than an actually different game. Battlefront was given the golden opportunity to become the first game of the Star Wars franchise on current gen (PS4, Xbox One) consoles as all the Battlefront games before than was on PC,PS2,Original Xbox and Xbox 360 but it cannot surpass it's predecessors. Lack of large-scale space warfare hurt the game and dealt a powerful blow to fans of the Star Wars franchise. Battlefront's music choice is also very basic I can almost hear the same track playing on any mission I choose to play.

The original version is one-third of an actual game, and the Star Wars Battlefront: Ultimate Edition is still unacceptable at full price. My biggest issue with this game is its lack of a story-mode. Online never has appealed to me, so the only gaming experiences I am interested in are single-player driven. I honestly wouldn't mind the fact that this game has no story mode had it not taken the classic Battlefront franchise, both of which had excellent single-player campaigns that were intriguing and fun to play through. The fact that EA and DICE thought that a campaign mode was unnecessary really shows far removed this game is from the original two games. The game is unpolished, with a number of animation glitches happening within the first few hours of the game. The heroes, while fun to play as, feel stupidly overpowered while playing with bots, and as a result the biggest thing Star Wars: Battlefront had going for it added thirty minutes of playtime, only ten of which were refreshing. I can guess that the heroes are more fun to play as in the online mode, but I've read that people will just hang back and steal the hero tokens so nobody except a few people will every play as heroes. The other single-player modes are fine, but there is so little substance here that they all feel stale, boring, and repetitive. There's nothing of interest on these linear, barren maps, so no match feels distinct, not to mention the fact that everything in this game is so limited in terms of substance. There are no open-ended systems to use to your advantage, and no clever physics. This game is so limited, and I think that is the root of all the problems here. Yes the aesthetics have been nailed, and everything looks and sounds authentic to the Star Wars universe, but nothing about the gameplay actually reinforces the visuals, and as a result Star Wars: Battlefront lacks any sort of depth or interest.

I havent bought EA since inquisition and i even bought that second hand so ea wouldn't get the money. Why? Because anyone who isnt a lying scumbag has know for over a decade that THIS is how EA opperates and always will. So if everyone knows they are a garbage greedy game company, than how is EA still in business you might ask. The reason is simple and its likely the same reason that SWBF2 will sell millions of copies and make EA a ton of money. That reason? That ppl today are worthless d bags who want everyone ELSE to boycott to get the problem fixed. Somebody ELSE should return their pre order. Someone ELSE needs to teach EA to respect its customers. But \"I\" dont want to have to be bothered. This is why things are the way they are. EA might respond to a real boycott, but they arent going to fix squat cause 600 thousand keyboard warriors on reddit started sobbing. Want to know how im right? Because they \"fixed\" your \"outrage\" by cutting the price of hero's by 75%. But why isnt that a fix you ask? BECAUSE THEY CUT DOWN ON HOW MUCH CREDITS YOU CAN EARN BY PLAYING THE GAME BY, anyone want to guess how much? EXACTLY......... 75%. So for those weak in math. If your bills go down 75% at the same time your pay gets dropped 75% your in the EXACT same position. EA just did the rope a dope and TONS of ppl are falling for it.

But SWBF 2 simply sucks.  Even apart from the possibility of pay to win microtransactions, this is the worst shooter I've ever played.  First, the game does not run smoothly.  Player movement is jerky and stuttering, which makes it impossible to aim properly.  Second, I have a question:  is my weapon supposed to harm the enemy?  Because mine never does.  Server lag is a big problem.  Often, I get the jump on the enemy, I shoot them multiple times point blank, and they just won't go down.  It's not uncommon for me to die, and then see my killer appear from behind cover after I'm already dead.  In other words, I never had a chance to shoot back because the server was too slow letting me know he was there.  Third, the maps are poorly designed.  Good shooters have well thought out maps that are conducive to interesting, enjoyable combat.  But with these maps, players just run all over the map willy nilly without purpose, trying to kill randomly and collect points so that they can come back as some uber hero.  You spend all your time simply trying to find the enemy, and then before you do, you get ear holed by some cheesy mechanic, such as a hero, before you ever have the chance to use your blaster.  Fourth, controller responsiveness is poor.  The circle button is supposed to make your character roll and crouch.  But the response is hit and miss.  Sometimes they crouch when you want to roll, roll when you want to crouch, but more often than not it just does neither one, especially when someone is shooting at you.  Shield doesn't deploy when I need it.  Grenade won't throw when I need it.  Etc...  Finally, character advancement gives higher level players a big advantage.  It is, in a very real sense, pay to win.  Other shooters have been smart enough to make advancement more about fun abilities, and not about dominating the battlefield with uber abilities and heroes.

No thank you, I'll gladly refrain for paying for this POS and spend my money on companies games that care about their customers and giving riveting story and gameplay that lasts for countless hours and you have a sense of accomplishment and it doesn't  rely heavily on how much you seem to have in your wallet. Gamers are giving in way too much and supplying game companies with revenue and an excuse to get away with cutting things from the final game and making you pay extra for DLC or for \"deluxe special day one pre-order bonuses\".

The micro-transactions that are the bedrock of this game would be shameful in a free to play mobile game. Battlefront 2 was created in a way to take exorbitant amounts of time to unlock anything. Originally EA wanted it to take forty hours of multiplayer game play to unlock Darth Vader or Luke Skywalker. That's eighty hours for both of them. All progression is based around loot boxes, ever time you want to upgrade your character it comes down to chance. EA is hoping that after the two loot boxes you open after tens of hours of game play and still not getting what you want, you will be more likely to break down and spend more money to get what you want. The arcade mode, which is an offline component of the multiplayer will not allow you to earn anymore credits towards unlocking loot boxes after two matches.

I felt like I was just getting lucky whenever I won a match, because a game being this pay-to-win is just exploitative. It just saps all the fun away when the game urges you to just pay real money for the best gear/content instead of getting more skilled at the game by playing. You didn't earn the victory, so where's the fun? What will we be left with when the servers shut down? A crippled husk of a game which there is no reason to return to.

Also, the game was geared to be multiplayer anyway and not to take away from online but I was even more happy that the arcade mode provided a base reason for those without internet connection to still be able to play.

The star cards can change the speed of the ship, the rate of fire of the guns, In  my opinion in  Star Fighter needs a rework of the star cards to not me so overpowered"], ["1Saints0ne1", "User", "8", "\u042f \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0434\u044f\u0442 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443, \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c, \u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0433\u043b\u0443\u043f\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0432. \u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u043b\u043b. \u041d\u043e \u0442\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0434\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433 \u0437\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0438 \u043a\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044b \u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0442 \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e-\u0433\u043b\u0443\u043f\u043e, \u0432\u0435\u0434\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430  \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c\u044e \u043d\u0438\u0445. \u0418\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443 \u0437\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u0439."], ["Gallogen", "User", "9", "We should appreciate the game itself but not the lootbox system that can be changed in future.

The gunplay is a lot better than the first but there isn't much in terms of weapon variety, and some weapons are too weak and aren't viable at all.

I actually don't mind being able to unlock heroes with credits because it gives you something to grind for (obviously the 40 hour grind was a bit much but it's much more reasonable now). The campaign is also a bit too short which was disappointing, but not unexpected by todays standards. The crate system is definitely a bit much, would honestly not care if either you couldn't buy them with real money (just credits), or make them cosmetic only, but right now I haven't felt like I was at a disadvantage because I refused to purchase any crates.

The polish and detail are there, the sights and sounds that only Star Wars encapsulates. Without a strict corporate development timeline I am sure the campaign would have been more fleshed out and involved. That is after all what made the original BF games so fantastic, along with the varied modes of game play which are also missing. Here you have the short 5 hour campaign, arcade mode and multiplayer of course. Which leads to the games greatest flaw, the loot system. Giving players the ability to (foolishly) dump real world cash into improving their character ruins the game. Players resistant to this system will immediately be at a disadvantage. Yes EA has \"temporarily\" rid the game of this paid system, but for how long? Until the storm dies down and social media finds a new topic. Video games and their industry were once on the fringe, yes profit was involved but there seemed to be a certain unspoken rule when it came to games, such as you knew what to except out of a game and its creators. When you bought a game you bought the finished product, and it was often full of surprise and wonder. Games were made by gamers for gamers and the proof was in the product. Now the dark cloud of corporate greed looms overhead, ever growing and suffocating the industry in order to extract every penny. New titles are often a disappointment, as strict timelines lead to even worse presentations. Barely complete projects sold at full retail price, requiring the players to pour even more money into the game to acquire the finished product is becoming the norm. And eventually this will conclude in an implosion of the industry, with only indie developers remaining once the dust settles as wall street scrambles to sell, sell, sell!

The story does a good job getting me to care about the characters, however there were moments that felt like they were missing due to how the story constantly shifts between character perspectives and emotions. Iden Of course, the visuals and audio are both stunning, and as a result, Battlefront II feels like a very authentic Star Wars experience. At points, the aesthetics were able to sell moments in which mechanics were very unimpressive, which can only be achieved through some top-notch design. However there were certain moments when even they failed to keep my interest, for example in the beginning of the campaign. In my opinion, this is one of Battlefront II's weakest moments. The first few minutes of a game are some of its most important, and should demonstrate to the player exactly how the rest of the game is going to play out. For example, take a look at how Bloodborne handles its first moments of gameplay. After grabbing basic weapons, the player is immediately forced into a fight against an extremely aggressive enemy. This not only teaches what is important about the game, (the combat), but also teaches the way enemies will fight and how they as the player will have to retaliate if they're going to survive this grueling experience. The first minutes of Battlefront II have the player flying a droid around a ship, which is a mechanic which never resurfaces in later chapters. This lasts for five minutes, after which the player is encouraged to use stealth, which is not a viable strategy in later chapters due to the positioning of enemies. These beginning moments are boring, disconnected, and do a terrible job establishing the rest of the game. The flying mechanics introduced in Chapter 2 are more involved than the first game, however the controls feel slightly clunky which resulted in a few deaths that I thought weren't entirely my fault. The game doesn't demonstrate what it does best until Chapter 3. This chapter and the others like it do a good job putting a unique spin on the mechanics typically used in these games, and as a result there are some moments that are unique to only this game, which fixes one of my biggest complaints about the first Star Wars Battlefront reboot. These sections do get a bit too disconnected at times, Chapter 12 feels extremely out of place, but as a whole they are a very positive addition to the game. Unfortunately, their inclusion means that no mission with Iden stands out in my mind. They weren't technically bad, however they're all very interchangeable, bland, and basic, mostly due to the fact that they're all very linear. There are a few collectibles to pick up along the way, however there are no branching paths to explore, and only a few of the gun battles have an interesting layout. They almost entirely take place on flat ground with cover strewn evenly throughout the arena, as opposed to something like Uncharted 4, which not only had a unique style due to how the hide-and-seek mechanics worked, but also had sections of level that could be grappled, there were slides, and there was some depth to the levels not present in Battlefront II. The abilities somewhat address this issue, but none of them are expanded upon enough or necessary enough to be excusable. The final campaign mission is also interesting because it's interconnected, and is the only stage to actually have a boss during its finale. Admittedly, the boss is very underwhelming and the mechanics are never anything more than the ship combat used in the rest of the game but it was more than I was expecting, which is a sentiment that can be applied to most of this game. It may not be great in any way, however it's enough of an improvement for its existence to be justified in my opinion. The microtransactions are obviously manipulative, and the multiplayer may not be worth playing with them, and the campaign overall felt lackluster and disappointing. So I'm going to give Star Wars Battlefront II a 4 out of 10."], ["cem12", "User", "7", "Pros:"], ["cubbybgood", "User", "8", "Most of these people that have left a review on Battlefront 2 have not actually bought or even played the game.

The arcade mode is weird ill say and repetitive cause all u do is Kill guys with heros or troopers with a time limit or how many u have to kill it just boring some try to add stuff in the hardest mode like if u die u reset the whole thing or u cant use abilities which is nice to try mix things up but it not really helping the repetitive part of it now MP is Really fun The graffics are AMAZING and i love to look at every detail there is one everything and now the star cards ill get it out of the way are Ok to me atleast they are some that are overpowered to certain characters like some of Boba fett ones and The microtransactions i never got the game when they were in but i can tell with the star card system THEY WERE F###ING HORRIBLE and the lootbox system before was like a rigged claw games u see at like arcades or toysRus cause all u got before was commons and more commons u will get rares or super rares at some points but it was rigged before and maybe still is at times without the microtransactions in the game now i been getting more greens offtain so i dont know anymore but the gameplay is fun the best modes are starfighter assault which is just your battling in space with your ships one team trying to do all the objective like blow up the fuel tanks in the ship while the other team has to kill them all it not for everyone but i like it. galactic assault  which is like rush and conquest from Battlefield and payload from TF2 or overwatch when your in the AT AT it the main mode and really fun can be repetitive but not bad heros versus villains is u pick a hero if your on the hero side or a villain if your on the villain side and it picks a a target and u have to kill that target first the one team who gets the other teams points to 0 wins i play it sometimes not alot tho it more fun with friends sometimes. blast Just Teamdeath match from Call of duty run around shooting people to get points and the most points by the end of the time or hits the max wins it a ok mode and last is strike which i never really played or liked it just smell maps with a objective and the team the does that objective wins like one team has to defend a ship and the others have to blow it up which ever ones does there objective wins it ok mode i barely play it. there no Season pass which is a good thing the mircotransactions was there season past but that removed for now i dont know if there ever bringing them back or not (Plz never bring them back) but still nice to get free maps and new heros and modes and new campaign missions. Now campaign the last thing i never did the campaign but seen vids about it i dont want to spoil anything about the story incase anyone wants to play it but the story from what i seen is OK to bad it not worth what i seen i heard it repetitive and the marketing for the campaign was a lie it spoilers to say what it was so i wont say it but the campaign your choice if u want to do it or not. that is all i have to say about this game i gave it a 7 cause me and my brothers play it alot and i think it fun with friends it will never beat the old BF2 but still a fun game has alot problems that depends on the person to ignore or not 7.0 for me i hope this review helps u want to buy the game or not"], ["jhoshypher", "User", "9", "DICE hizo un juego con mec\u00e1nicas y gameplay muy divertido, ademas lo de las micro-transacciones puedes dejarlas de lado y no pasa nada."], ["Spitbot", "User", "5", "Star Wars Battlefront 2 is perhaps the most conflicted I've ever felt about a video game."], ["JBS", "User", "1", "Buggy, glitchy, broken piece of sputum.

But for only $15, I decided to go with my gut instinct and give it a try. And almost immediately, I was addicted, and realized I was playing a very special, and unique game.  Stardew Valley is incredibly open ended, although there are objectives to be completed occasionally, especially in the beginning.  Also, there's optional, timed tasks, that are periodically displayed on the bulletin board in the town square.  But the great part is, out of all the activities the game offers, from upgrading your farm, fishing, mining, foraging, and being social, it never forces you to do any of them. The solitary creator of this game lets you play it your way.  Do you want to fish on the river banks all day, everyday?  Go for it, just don't expect to get a dance partner at the local festival.  You aren't punished for not completing tasks, but you're rewarded the more you engage in a particular activity, and you're often given upgrades, and new crafting recipes for your work, making any activity feel meaningful and fulfilling.  The game is set up in days that last around 15-20  real world minutes, and spans through all four seasons (complete with unique musical themes)  Each day on the calendar has the potential to be important.  It could be someone's birthday, or a seasonal festival.  The music is amazingly atmospheric as well.  One of my only complaints about the game is that the music too often abruptly stops, and you're left in silence for the remainder of the day.  There really needs to be a way to loop the music for continuous play. Also, it would be nice to have tutorial pages available, should the player need them. But these are small complaints.  Stardew Valley has more charm, and attention to detail than most triple A games.  It seriously proves how passion alone can create a superior product, despite a low budget.  I'm about 20 hours in, and there is so much I haven't done or seen.  And I've never been bored, not even once.  This game could have been an endless, tedious, farming grind.  But farming is only the tip of the iceberg. It's a relaxing experience that can be played any way you see fit. There are so many features I didn't even touch on in this review. Despite a few flaws, Stardew Valley is a near masterpiece, and nearly unfathomable it was created by one person. Although the game can seem daunting at first, it's the exact opposite.

The platforming is top- notch, every cave is different with a unique theme, and the fact that you have to find the cave in the first place to then complete it, to then get the rewards make it ultra satisfying. Back tracking into the caves after getting new abilities to find hidden items is ultra satisfying. Looking for hidden areas after exploring and hearing that jingle just to get more cogs never gets boring to me, ultra satisfying. The main theme of the game digging underground with an axe to get to next objective while also mining for resources to upgrade your weapons is ULTRA satisfying and ADDICTING. Mining for resources is soooo addicting and everytime there is a tile with resources I never hestitate to go take a detour and hack away just to get $3. The world is also very colorful and fun to look at. The story while takes a back seat to gameplay builds around the mystery of the main character from the first game, so to me it's fine (since gameplay is so addicting). It took me 12 hours for one playthrough, but to others it might only be 6-8. To end, I love this game, love this series, it's not for everyone but to me it's a must play.

It's pretty cool and ends up kinda becoming a metroidvania as a result. I like the tone of the game but the characters aren't as memorable as Steamworld Heist especially the towns people. Story is simple, I think one more plot point would have made it feel like a complete arch. Exploring the mines though is where it's at. Digging around trying to find a path to your objective and making sure to get loot on the way is the core of the game. There is combat but it's a side dish. I do want to point out that I think the light mechanic is unnecessary.  So, you have a lantern and fuel runs out pretty quick usually before you even have a full bag of loot to sell. What happens when it runs out is that the surrounding area gets really dark. It's cumbersome but you could power through it if you want. Or just go back to town. There's really no purpose in watching your fuel meter because the punishment for running out is so minimum. If they made it so you couldn't survive long without light and forced you to make sure you were near a checkpoint (tube back to town) while running low that could have been an interesting mechanic. What's funny is that this whole mechanic only exists in the early game because eventually you can get an upgrade so your fuel never runs out. So, what was the point in having it in at all? Idk.

The story isn't pretentious, or overladen, and the game focuses almost entirely on gameplay.  And luckily, the gameplay is extremely addicting and fun. After a brief tutorial, Steep unleashes you into its rather large open world to do as you please. You can free roam or participate in the plethora of challenges (after finding them with your binoculars.)  The challenges are, well...challenging.  Many will take repeated attempts to conquer and secure a gold medal.  The challenges themselves are varied and some have you trekking across the various mountains to reach a single checkpoint any way you see fit, which is a great departure from the races, or point challenges. Some of the challenges can be difficult to master, and will require multiple runs to complete. Luckily, if you crash, or you're just not having a good run, you can immediately start over with a touch of a button.  In fact, at any time, you can spawn at any point of interest, or challenges you've found.  Later, with enough leveling up, the game gives you access to an unlimited number of free helicopter tickets allowing you to spawn wherever you please on the map.  The 4 sports themselves (paragliding, wingsuit, snowboard, skis)  are varied enough to keep things fresh and interesting. The sense of speed in Steep is also incredible.  Find the right path, and you'll be screaming down the slopes.  One aspect that keeps this game from being a complete arcade experience is the G Force meter.  Enough clunky landings, or riding on rocks will throw you from your board, or skis.  It's a great mechanic that requires the player to get better, and keesp the game a bit grounded. (Pardon the pun) Graphically, Steep is a mixed bag.  At times, it's gorgeous, but sometimes the visuals creep into last gen territory.  But overall, the game looks fine.  And more importantly, aside from lag here and there, it runs very smoothly. There is quite a bit of outfits and equipment to choose from to customize your character too. As a complete package, Steep is a great game that's easy to jump into and have fun, but it takes time to master.  And the icing on the cake is that the game allows you to choose from different genres of music that can drastically change the atmosphere of the game.  You can 'rock' out while scoring an insane amount of points, or just 'chill' out and cruise down the slopes, or explore the world at a relaxing pace.  I imagine Steep is a rather large risk for Ubisoft.  I for one, believe it paid off.  Steep can be a relaxing, sublime experience, or a white knuckle race to the finish line.

Well, my roommate and I are pretty much unable to play the game. The online has been spotty, there's no arcade mode, and there's no local multiplayer (for us), until Capcom puts out a patch. They (Capcom) told us to \"hang tight\", and that they would fix the local multiplayer glitch during the big June update.

The hype leading to the next iteration of Street Fighter is upon us. Unfortunately, Capcom has severely destroyed and broke gamers hearts with this release. First and foremost, SFV is lacking significantly in content and that is an understatement. No Arcade, No gallery, No ladder, Online is currently broken, REQUIRES INTERNET CONNECTION TO EARN XP AND CAPCOM CURRENCY. Which is big considering that ONLINE is broken. Additionally, Story mode is 4 matches long and the cutscenes are longer than the actual matches. This is due to the cpu setting which is on EASY, and there is no ADJUSTING the DIFFICULTY. So I ask, WHAT IS WORTH 60 bucks?? Not this PRE access game with only 16 playable characters, and I believe eight stages. Now, when we see a limited amount of characters, one would believe that each character would have depth. Unfortunately, the characters are very bare-bones as well. Newcomers are short on specials and each character has ONE SPECIAL ART. I am not sure if more special arts are unlocked but at this current stage of the game, that is it.

If your only focus is online multiplayer or tournament-style competition, then you may feel like SFV is streamlined to your liking, but casual players wanting solo modes will be sorely disappointed. Capcom has built the game with a DLC release schedule in mind, and it will take several months of both paid and free downloads to make it feel complete. Even the story mode barely passes as an introduction to the 16-character roster, as it currently features 4 low-tier fights with some quick graphic novel cutscenes in between. It's nice that we get Japanese and English dual audio, partially because the English voice acting is a mixed bag and nowhere near the quality I'd expect from a high-profile release like this. Street Fighter devotees will be pleased to know that the narrative is pushed in some interesting directions, but it's far from poetry. Also, the new characters are [arguably] better than the ones we got in SFIV's initial release, but they still don't feel as iconic as the series mainstays, many of whom will remain absent until several waves of DLC have passed. The new mechanics are solid and perhaps more balanced for competitive play, and the graphics are fluid and crisp, if the weird caricature art style doesn't turn you off. Sound effects and music are also decent, but the intro lacked any real punch, something I really enjoyed in the earliest SFIV releases and even SFxTK. I really want to like SFV, but in its current state, it really fails to excite me the way a good fighting game should. Inevitably, we'll end up with Super Street Fighter V Turbo: Arcade Edition (or something to that effect) in a year or so, and while I know most gamers won't be able to wait that long, I doubt anyone will look back at this launch fondly.

Capcom asked fans would they want the game out early with mechanics and online or have them delay it and put all the features in and the fans wanted it early. People need to understand this and appreciate the game for what it is. You can play with your friends in your home or online. Sure the lobby is only for two players but that will improve over time. I give this game a 9 out of 10 because it's an awesome fighting game and I feel like I've gotten my money's worth already. I bought two madcatz TE2+ just for this game and don't regret any of it.

Gamers constantly argue that magazines are giving them fraudulent reviews for games. \"The industry wants to boost sales of games, the reviews are bought, yadda, yadda..\" all very true. But, in this case, I agree with the magazine reviews much more than the independent reviews. These days, it seems to be popular to bash games for lack of content. I get it, and I agree. Content is lacking in many games, and sure, some content is missing in this game. The fact that there is no way to play the computer in an arcade mode is kind of inexcusable. I also don't understand why something as simple as the challenge mode wasn't available on launch day. But, cool. It all comes down to the fact that, in the end, none of this affects the game play, and Capcom is quickly releasing free content for the game. So.. be patient! What matters most is that the game play in this game is AMAZING. This is easily one of the best fighting games I've ever played in terms of actual game play, if not THE BEST. If Capcom put extra effort into developing the game play over content, I'm pretty sure I can forgive them. Game play is much more important. Games are massively harder to develop these days. Stop living in the past. When I was growing up in the 90's a new game was $50.00. That's pretty much equivalent to $80.00 in buying power in 2016. If Capcom needs to release some stuff for free later, and add some downloadable content that costs a little bit of money, I will forgive them. The important part is that the game play IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT. Stop whining, stop giving unhonest \"0\" reviews, and enjoy this game.

The story takes place after the events of SAO (Sword Art Online), in which they were trapped in a game where if they died there, they would die in the real world. The characters from the previous anime and games return and play the SAO again, this time without the risk of death. For the first time in the series, you can make your own character, instead of being Kirito. For once, i was able to enjoy feeling as if i were a part of SAO and its lovable characters. The story is about a strange NPC who gives a strange quest for 1 col. You and the cast find this strange and try to solve the quest, eventually finding out that she is a goddess and she could possibly destroy the entire game if the quest is completed. There is more, but i won't give any more details. The main story left me interested, but it certainly was boring in a lot of parts. It left me aching for the excitement and intensity that i got from the anime. While the story was boring, the combat was amazing. You can pick from many different types of weapons to choose from, all having tons of skills and perks that left me trying out all weapons to see what fit me. However, the skill tree is..... littered. It has so many stats just mushed together, with no tutorial to help me figure it out, that i just gave up and used what i was able to piece together.    Enemies were plentiful, bosses were exciting, and there were also tons of extra mini bosses, or NM's, that u could kill for rare weapons or XP.  Multiplayer is also a good way to level your character, and you can fight bosses or just farm for items together with your friends. All in all, while this game has some undeniable flaws, its still a solid game. While the story falls short, combat, multiplayer, and extra bosses made me come back time and time again.

Instead of getting a fluid control scheme i got a crappy free to play mmo control scheme that just doesnt work on a controller. Seriously, the little grid palette that you can place skills on kept popping open even without me tapping the touch pad and intefering with what i already had set on my circle button. Combat feels sluggish and not fluid at all like they got lost in that gray area between quasi-mmo and hack and slash combat. And perhaps one od my biggest irks is the overemphasis on the dating sim element and what they hide behind it. You cant change the gear of your party members without raising their affinity level high enough. Really, they hide an integral part of party based rpg combat behind a dating sim game. Ok thatd be fine if the dating sim thing was actually any fun at all. For example, Sinon starts at level 3 for affinity and she was the first one i tried this one. You have to get to level 4 to swap her weapons and level 5 to switch her armor and accesories. I used  \"fast\" method that loops 5 events in your room at the inn in about 8 minute dialougue segements. It was then i endured the most painful 3 hours of my life. Thats right 3 HOURS. 3 god forsaken hours of the same 8 minute dialogue segment in what has to be the one of the most disrespectful minigame ive ever played in my life. Seriously i dont even care for the feminist movement most of the time, but the fact that you can go up to a girl who is in a \"normal\" mood at level of \"friendly\", and go straight in to a kiss with no negative consequence at all. You just nod to the rest of her statments and all of a sudden her mood is romantic and that fixed the fact that you seriously overstepped your boundaries and basically sexually harassed your \"friend\". Keep in mind thats for one person. To be able to change the gear of your entire party you would have to go through almost 10 hours of that awful dating sim, just to swap the gear of your party members. God forbid if you decide to switch up your party members down the road. Ive logged about 20 hours and i have seriously been bored for just about all 20. Still barely have any clue what the hell the main story is about, you just cant justify pacing that slow. I love SAO with all my heart, i really do. But there is no way to justify this awful pile of trash. A game shouldnt bore me 20 hours in, nor should basic mechanics be hiding behind the worlds worst dating sim ever.

Sword Coast, in my opinion, is an upgrade on story line over Pillars as well as overall game play. Yes, in Sword Coast you will have to control the other characters in your party but only to do simple tasks such as switching to the rogue to detect traps, secret doors and unlock chests but during battle you can feel confident just playing your own character and relying on the games AI to properly control the other characters.
