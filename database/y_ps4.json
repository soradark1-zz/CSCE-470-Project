There are many innovative ways of keeping up the challenge level as the game progresses and the fighting never really feels burdensome, which is quite a feat.

Hardly any of the monsters receive 3D-models, the first player doesn't get to draw a card, and some trap cards which are supposed to stop magic spells don't actually stop them. I think Yu-Gi-Oh could have a much better game if they created a story for it, made sure the rules were correct, and had 3D-models for every card in the game, at least monsters if not all."], ["Cruzi", "User", "8", "It's a solid Yu-Gi-Oh! game and as someone who only played the original card game back in the days, the game offers neat little tutorials that introduce you to the new cards and mechanics that have been added over the years.

Es ideal para probar mazos y combinaciones de cartas que a uno se le ocurran, los desafios de duelista estan muy bien ya que la IA pesee muy buenos mazos que rapidamente quieres armar y poder usar (aqui todo consiste en prueba y error, probar y sacar cartas como en la vida real). El problema que le veo es el de no poder desbloquear cartas a gusto (cuando ganas o compras el pack de cartas las que te vienen son al azar) por lo que gastas muchisimas horas jugando para obtener una carta que quieres y termina siendo muy frustante. No me gusta para nada el hecho de no incluir la campa\u00f1a del arco 5 de yugioh aunque almenos hay cartas pendulo por lo que no es tan terrible. Excelente juego si lo que se quiere es revivir la infancia y eres fanatico de yugioh."], ["salamanca", "User", "7", "Growing up, I played the original Yu-Gi-Oh! card game with just about anyone I could find.
