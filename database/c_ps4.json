The game unfolds in a plausible future in which technological, telesis and today's military practices have converged with real world consequences. In this image of the future, Private Military Corporations have become the dominant armed forces for many countries who must outsource their military needs, redrawing borders and rewriting international law.  Irons, the founder and president of the world's largest PMC, Atlas Corporation, is at the vortex of these tectonic plates.", "reviews": [["IGN", "Critic", "91", "This is a Call of Duty game to its core, but one that rehashes as little as possible while still retaining its strengths."], ["Impulsegamer", "Critic", "90", "Call of Duty Advanced Warfare once again proves why this series is so popular with its next-gen physics and flawless gameplay."], ["PSX-Sense.nl", "Critic", "90", "The exosuit launches the series to new, refreshing and necessary heights, giving both single- and multiplayer a major leg up.

The only thing that they changed has been the fact you can jump real high and climb up on stuff, which sounds cool at first, until you realize you move really slow and jumping makes you a bigger/slower target (just like sprinting). So what will happen is, you will run into a room, and get shot in the back by a guy standing in the corner, Just like every other Call of Duty Game ever. The random respawns are horribly annoying because people spawn directly behind you and shoot you in the back. (classic call of duty) The story mode is a joke. I played through the entire Call of Duty Ghost's campaign and thought it was okay it was short but i liked it for the most part. But this is just horrible, The character progression the story, everything seems like a crappy fiction story someone wrote at 12 years old. The graphics are extremely overrated, Lots of terrible terrible environments made shiny by some filters, I wish I could attach some pictures highlighting this, but I cannot.

The whole thing follows the formula of previous COD's and adds virtually nothing new. Remember 'that' All Gullied Up mission from COD 4 Modern Warfare?

And there is the bit where you have to hide and wait for yet another convoy to go by. It just recycles missions from past COD's again. I'm amazed that they even attempted to get away with this, again! It really is short of imagination. The only new things really are a \"double jump\" and a \"dodge move\". Advanced Warfare is touted as an all new game that will reignite the franchise. But i don't see how giving people more of the same is doing that. The Future setting has been done to death now too. And Advanced Warfare is basically Black Ops 2.5. It needs to  go back to more realistic, current or past warfare. The graphics aren't anything special either. Because the game runs at 60FPS means the graphics have to take a hit. As a result, interiors etc feel very plain, and the maps in multiplayer are dead when it comes to detail and content. But that's the price you have to pay when you want a game to run at 60FPS. Multiplayer is also more of the same but with different guns and a few extra moves.

Either way, very interesting campaign, great multiplayer with lots of customization. I especially love the customization to the score streaks, the extra exoskeleton stuff, the guns and maps could do better though. I've only played the 3 most recent games of the franchise, Black Ops II, Ghosts and Advanced Warfare, and I have to say that the guns in Black Ops II were better.

During the first week of playing this I really enjoyed it and thought it was going to be one of my favorites. I stopped playing AW completely after less than a month. I've played every COD since MW4 except for AW for at least 3-4 months before getting bored of it. Two critical problems: 3D movement and time to kill. Both of these factors combined means that you'll get shot in your blind areas and die quickly. My KD ratio has been 2+ since BLOPS 1 but in AW it was exactly 1.00. There's hardly any gunfights. That's what makes COD fun. That's the point. When you die very very quickly and can get shot from 18 different angles you and your enemy will just take turns killing each other in your blind spots. It's just boring as f*ck and the reason I stopped playing.

I enjoyed the games campaign mode it was full of decent varied missions from the stealth where you have to not be detected to the all out mayhem of just blowing stuff up and endless killing. the best part about these missions are the new Exo abilities, though they are only tailor made for each mission which could've been better allowing you to chose which abilities you wanted they were decent though i did find myself just wanting the double jump. another downside there is only one mission which allows you to use the stealth suit exo which I found rather enjoyable, yes you can use it online but it is easily visible to the other players and quite obvious the person is there if you pay attention. Now onto the main part of the review, which yes I am writing this a bit out of anger due to my last play session, the online multiplayer is fun. as long as you have friends to play with and talk to; to keep yourself from concentrating too much. (if you're a player like I am, who games better when not putting all my brain power into getting revenge over other players who have P****d me off) I found myself struggling to play online well enough to not want to rage quit the matches and stay online due to not having many friends who I talk to and play with online on this new iteration. when playing online I found myself playing against people who have put hours into each map to find the best spots to camp or to head glitch and make sure they're nigh invisible. The online aspect of the game is quiet well rounded and I like the new 'Supply Drops' which give you new equipment such as guns with stat boosts which come with a downgrade to other stats to equal it out. I also enjoy customising my character to make them my own by using the equipment gained from 'Supply Drops' the graphics on the game are phenomenal this is mostly noticed when it comes to the cut scenes within the story as i felt like the characters looked as close to real as i have ever seen in a game. I got a bit side tracked, back to Multiplayer, the addition of the double boosts and dashes as such are a good addition to the game to make it that much more fast paced which is what i like about Call of Duty games, their pace the gameplay in this addition reminds me of MW2 which is great as that is one of my favourites in the series. In also like the map design there are several different styles of maps which is great as there are maps which want you to keep moving and jumping around but doing so does put you at a bit of a disadvantage as it makes you vulnerable, but there are other maps which rely on close combat and quick wits and reactions.

If you have no good luck your screwed because you cant get elite weapons, elite weapons is a modified version of the normal gun you unlock at the start. In the old call of duties I loved to put my sensitivity low since people wouldn't move as fast but now  its really annoying how people are jumping left right and center I cant keep track, I have to put my sensitivity high but its so fast its annoying. Exo abilities and exo launchers the the most stupid idea ever made, tactical grenades and primary grenades share the same slot so now you can only equip one kind of grenade. With exo abilities sledgehammer added something called \"exo mute device\" which would replace the old perk dead silence so now your footsteps will only be silenced for a few seconds, also \"exo cloak\" you are literally invisible and cannot be seen at all which gets on your nerves since people run invisible with a shotgun shooting you from no where. Score streaks are very short and don't last long, most of them you have to control yourself like the warbird, paladin, Vulcan, Goliath, missile strike, aerial recon drone aerial assault drone, remote turret, I basically just named all the score streaks except for 4 of them. Usually I like staying on the ground finding people to kill while the chopper is in the air getting kills as well but you have to control the choppers now so there is a disadvantage for you. Most of the CoD community ruins the game by camping, running in pairs, trash talking, and just ruining the game mode like domination. In domination the objective is to capture flags and get the most points and still get kills but most people would just hold down 2 so the other team would not leave and you understand where the spawns are and the game last longer so you get more kills, about 40-50 kills each game. Now in CoD AW everyone just cares about holding all flags, you get at least 15-25 kills each game since everyone is so focused on holding every flag.

So going light keeps you from the light heavymachines and going heavy means you can't pick assualt rifles or SMG.  Modern Warfare lets you unlock anything in their survival mode. It just feels like a step backwards. Then there's the whole zombie DLC thing which at first was a annoyed that players have to dish out more cash for zombies but I thought, maybe the whole DLC will just focus on zombies. Nope. 1 freaking map for zombies and the rest for multiplayer in which I always felt wasting money for map packs was a waste. And for those of you saying that it's not the same developer that does zombies hence why it's \"ok\" that they are doing this know that Activision has overall control and anyone of them can make a zombie mode. Just because one is notorious for it doesn't make it ok for the other attempting it to charge people ridiculous amounts for what's always been in the game. Really if you want better games it's better to not pre-order and wait to see how the game is. Make developers realize that us players want better quality in our games. At least our 60$ worth.

Call of Duty was always fast but this one cranks it up ten notches to almost Unreal Tournament levels. Now I am aware that this comparison is almost blasphemous but I would say that Advanced Warfare is more in lines with it than Titanfall which just shares the aesthetically similar traits. It is fast, frantic, and for once is  a long time, almost tactical. You have options on how to approach every scenario.

Something not to worry about at first, but now it has been out for a month and I have not seen a single change, nothing to correct it.

It borrows a few aspects from science fiction games such as Destiny and Halo, and many criticise it for that. The Campaign takes away some good features that were introduced in Black Ops 2, such as customized loadouts and somewhat branching storylines, but adds some good features of its own such as the upgrade system, which works quite well. The campaign itself is way better than Call of Duty: Ghosts (take that for what you will), it features enjoyable missions and mission structure. The exosuit introduces some interesting abilities, such as overdrive abilities, riot shield, hover and other abilities that allow you to play the game to a whole new level. Comparing it to previous Call of Duty games, yes it is somewhat similar, but if you liked the previous games, you will definitely like this one. Exo Survival is another welcome addition, similar to Modern Warfare 3's survival mode, but slightly more complex. Exo Survival introduces objectives as you play, which you can complete for extra points, and you may be penalised for not doing so. I didn't play much Multiplayer, due to the fact it is mainly comprised of young children these days, but I did enjoy the matches I played. The Sniper-only mode was quite a fun and frantic one. But now, downsides: it is quite similar to previous games, some places seem to invoke a state of \"deja-vu\", and a lot of the good content (such as zombies) has been ripped out in favour of DLCs, which I continue to hate. I would be a lot happier if Activision made DLCs cheaper, or included some content in the main game. Of course, DLCs will be present in pretty much every game nowadays, so there's not really much point denying it. Safe to say, the people giving this game 1s and 2s are completely exaggerating, and they sadly dishonestly bring down the average. Anyways, I recommend that you find this game for a reasonable price (\u00a320-30). If you like the previous games, you'll enjoy it. If you didn't, it's best to avoid this one."], ["strawstram", "User", "8", "Advanced Warfare is overall a decent game.

During Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, the story is set in the future; that means jetpacks, and lasers! The gameplay mechanics are almost the same as previous Call of Duty titles, the only things that are new are jetpacks, lasers, guns that print their own bullets, different types of grenades, and the campaign. The campaign is very predictable, what you think that will happen at the start completely happens. There are barely any unexpected plot twists or changes in the story. The developers could have slightly changed the plot in order to make the story less predictable, but they decided not to for some reason. Also, most of the levels feel linear and scripted, except for one of them. The one level that did not feel linear and scripted is what the whole game should have been; this is a second time a good opportunity was passed up by the developers. Nevertheless, the game is fun; it's fun to pick up a controller and just shoot people without having to think about it. This may be why this game's multiplayer is so popular. There is practically no strategy in the online mode - as mentioned before, it is a twitch shooter. During the online mode, most of the players run around the map shooting each other like a bunch of chicken with their heads cut off, and the maps are designed for that.

Multiplayer show most players liking core TDM or Domination, but I'm a fan of CTF and I've spent 99% of my time playing that mode. I feels smooth and quick, but not stupid COD AW quick. The wall running is done well as to the double jump. There is the usual dsync moments you get with every FPS game.

Basically a copy and paste every single year."], ["SchroederRock", "User", "7", "This is lengthy, so skip to the end if you just want a summary.  Black Ops 3 is a tough decision for me in terms of rating.  In terms of the campaign, it has a bland start that had me asking a lot of fundamental questions that should have been better answered just by playing the game.  It isn't until mission 4 that things start to heat up a bit in terms of the fun-factor, but the story is still a bit buried.  Then, around the halfway mark, things start to click and Black Ops 3 takes off on a roller coaster ride that I've come to expect from this arm of the franchise.  The ending had me asking a lot of questions, but when I sought out answers, it made a LOT of sense and makes me understand why certain events in the game transpired the way they did (AFTER you\u2019ve beaten the campaign, read the very first quick-scroll mission statement text that appears during those black screens.  They\u2019re on YouTube and, if you slow it down to 25% play speed, you can play/pause your way through it and find an extremely interesting piece of info there.  Again, AFTER you beat the game go find this).  There is some room for interpretation, but the theories I arrived at connected all the dots extremely well.  Do not judge this story until you've done this for yourself, or you'll stamp poor writing in spots that are actually clever writing.  The scope of the gameplay while unfolding the story is a nice addition, but the added wall running and thrust jumping take a back seat more often and it's the DNI augmentations that give a soldier super-human powers that really shines here.  For the campaign, it nearly blew me away from start to end, but the fractured first few missions pulls it out of \"amazing\" territory and into the \"above-average\" category.  I haven't spent much time with zombies, but I will say this: beating the campaign is important as it unlocks the Nightmares mode where you rehash certain campaign levels with zombies in them instead of your soldier & robot enemies. Playing the first iteration was interesting since it meshes a lot of stuff of your typical zombies with a new somewhat-altered storyline.  But it isn\u2019t amazing because it\u2019s all retreaded story missions with a voice-over narrative that tries to fit what\u2019s already there, making it feel like a hashed together plan rather than a uniquely-crafted bonus feature.  As for the multiplayer, it's a mixed bag.  Treyarch largely keeps everything you've seen in previous Call of Duty titles, but the new opportunities for movement get left by the wayside too often.  I wanted a mixed Titanfall experience with the honed MP build of Call of Duty.  You get much more of the later than the former.  The new Specialist classes are a nice addition to the mix, but once you get outside of your thrusters and specialist abilities it's just CoD as usual.  Not one map feels like the fun playground you'd get on Titanfall, where the mindset of \"if you see it, you can play on/with it\" makes for a very changing battleground that keeps your head on a swivel better than any other shooter thus-far.  Add the terrible decision of using hybrid servers (part dedicated/part player hosted) and a complete meltdown in terms of online sustainability - something that is frustrating a majority of gamers out of the gate with BO3, and my playtime of Black Ops 3 feels stymied.  DLC is $50 for a seasons pass, $15 per installment (4 DLC packs total).  You\u2019re getting the usual 4 maps & a zombie expansion.  The problem is that games like Halo 5 are offering DLC for free and Destiny figured out how $40 can fund an entire year\u2019s worth of DLC, including the first major expansion (The Taken King) and using micro transactions that are not required to fund the extra nuances of the game.  This makes Black Ops 3 DLC look insignificant and scam\u2019ish.  \u2013SUMMARY-- Black Ops 3 is another mind-bending tale that requires all of your attention to figure out the storyline.  The attention to detail is almost consistent across the game\u2019s 11 missions, but a faulty starting left me wanting a bit more.  Once I got to the multiplayer, I again found myself with a desire for more.  Call of Duty isn\u2019t busting out of its shell that is really starting to hold it back, but the cracks in the hull suggest Activision is considering the possibility of pushing the limits.  I can\u2019t recommend the title, but I won\u2019t deter anyone from it either.  I just wish there was more of a playground feel to it all \u2013 that would make it a lot more fun.  Of course, if you want the worst news of all: Ghosts 2 is supposed to be up next for CoD.

So you walk in and you can see out of it and shoot out of it, and no one has any idea where you are until the killcam. Then you have the walls that aren't properly drawn in, which will at some point block your fully charged frag grenade, and it will kill you. Then you have the matchmaking and connectivity, which outright suck. Between the constant disconnects, the insane lag, and the obnoxious glitching it causes, it can be nearly impossible to play sometimes.

The specialists are well balanced and useful. The reason this review supports only a 9 is because of the belly-aching let-down of Zombies. The much anticipated Zombies storyline continues, but this time with very difficult environments, and tougher enemies making a solo experience impossible to enjoy. The Giant bonus map was also a big let-down, as it had changed to much and was all the more difficult to enjoy, wiping away my nostalgia. Perhaps adjustments can be made to respect this new zombies experience, but until I can, this review will remain at 9/10. Great camping and multiplayer, truly a game for all FPS fans."], ["tomaef", "User", "9", "This installment has copped too much illegitimate hate.

The new zombies offers a lot of new mechanics that are both fresh and welcomed. Now the campaign is just plain bad in fact at some points laughable. It out right corny.

Both Black ops 1&2 had the stick and stones mode where i could just do that, but for some reason, that doesn't exist on black ops 3 now.

Shotguns are extremely underrated, submachine guns (as is the usual with Treyarch) are great at hip firing, extremely accurate, and have little-to-no recoil, throwing the balance way off, i.e. it would take two headshots with a shotgun to kill someone about 2 meters away, and only two body shots from a submachine gun to kill someone from about 3 meters away. The fact that melee is a two-hit kill unless you use the Combat Knife is interesting, but not in the style of Call of Duty and a pretty gutsy feature from Treyarch.

I do not get upset with seeing relatively similar things in Ghosts as with previous instalments simply because at the Ghosts launch Infinity Ward didn\u2019t really promise much else therefore people should have known what to expect. It is, however, surprisingly bland and elements such as the maps are particularly disappointing in originality and it is here that I feel we have essentially been lied to because I.W. made so much noise about the interactivity of the online environment, suggesting this was a major development. So far I am yet to really see any trace of this other than someone getting a field order and it basically making the map turn a different colour.

It is far from this, but in principle deserves to get panned on the simple fact that the intense marketing was clearly a sales strategy to get as many first week sales as possible before they quickly drop off because Activision knew that deep down they did not have a game that matched the hype and they would soon be found out. And for the record the pre-launch sales strategy was unspeakably naff and cheesy and as a 31 year old had me feeling embarrassed to be a part of this dying franchise.

Wether your using the stealthily rappelling down skyscrapers, or driving a tank through the desert, Ghosts brings the full cinematic feel we've come to expect with the series. While Ghost's campaign leans between decent and good, the multiplayer is still as robust as ever. Infinity Ward has done a fantastic job in designing the new maps. For the first time in the series, maps contain several dynamic features, ranging from something as small as a tree falling over, to an air strike.

COD was always about small maps, fast gameplay, racking up massive kill streaks and using the simple maps to your advantage. The beauty was choosing your fav weapon and pwning for an hour or two in a highly addictive multiplayer. Now I can not bare to play for more than ten minutes. The maps are a mess, it's as if they let a kid loose of the Toni Hawks map creator. There is no symmetry, no logic, no routes to take. It's just a case of wondering round for two mins until you are shot in the back by a guy camping in a random spot. The levelling up system is a joke and upgrading weapons is overly complicated and takes for ever. They have removed imo the some of the best game types, Demolition and Search And Destroy. Kill streaks are impossible to get and the lag is worse than ever. I used to be a 2.5 kd average played, I've got Nukes and racked up kills of 100-12 in MW2.

The map does get old, but the first maps always have little problems. With more variety, extinction could become a big side game.

So, in other words, two bullets from about any gun will kill you before you can even aim down your sights.

I am not saying that they are similar games by any stretch.  I'm simply saying that for the first time in a long time I found myself wanting to get back to Battlefield.  Call of Duty Infinite Warfare is not a bad game at all.  Nothing in CoD IW screams incompetence.  It's more or less a tapped out resource.  I just cant do space right now lol.  IW is a fast paced, well put together fps, but I think it's downfall is going to be it's multiplayer.  One thing I was a bit excited for is maybe they would have some type of multiplayer space dog fights considering how  much you fly in the campaign, but that is not the case.  It is VERY much still CoD.  I cant say if it was Activision or Infinity Ward that decided to go with the pay 2 win mechanic but a terrible idea none the less.  Especially in a highly competitive shooter like CoD.  I know it may sound like I'm just a battlefield fan trying to crap on CoD but I have always LOVED both franchises for their differences but Infinite Warfare is just more CoD, whereas I think we as fans of CoD were ready for something new.  I had a lot more fun with MW 3 honestly.  No sliding, no double jump, no grapple, no wall running, just classic CoD.

Though there are a few moments where good ideas peek through, this game constantly fails to impress. Combat feels mundane, as if the folks at Infinity Ward and Activision want little to do with creating any strategic systems or burn the walls that prevent their games from feeling visceral - like we're actually experiencing all of this. I cannot feel any of it. The studios handling CoD continually detach gamers from stories, characters and plot development by always feeling the need to be dramatic and overly-cinematic. I feel like every moment is a near-brush with death and I get tired of it really quick. Not every moment has to or is a near-death experience and that crushes the dynamics of story telling. Comparing it to Titanfall 2, Infinite Warfare comes off looking like a game that has phoned it all in. There are no more ideas and no spouts of creativity. It's all fine-tuning the same game year after year. Sure, if you haven't played Call of Duty games before this will seem pretty decent but never great. As for the multiplayer - yawn. It's less flexible than Black Ops 3. In fact, it's basically Advanced Warfare 2 in many ways but even less exciting than that game was for me (although that campaign was good enough to finish). At this point, I want Call of Duty to die. It's a bad franchise that over-markets itself and steals available dollars from dramatically-better games. Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2 are so much better it makes Infinite Warfare look like a joke, and since the guys that made Modern Warfare/Modern Warfare 2 are leading the team over Titanfall/Titanfall 2, it's an easy recommendation for anyone looking for something familiar to Call of Duty but is either bored or just simply hates it.

This is actually a good COD game and I consider it better than Black Ops 3. The new loadout system is a nice approach and every piece of technology seems to make sense, it somehow fits into the lore. The setting and gear come together as more serious, way less childish than BO3. Movement is a may be a bit clunkier (like you can feel the weight of the armor) but I actually like that because it makes the game seem more down to earth. One of the best optimizations is that the game will load multiplayer maps while you are waiting in the lobby, so the loading times are super short. It also seems better optimized than BO3 - my PS4 remains surprisingly quite at all times, whereas sometimes while playing BO3 my console's fans would go absolutely berserk and I was expecting it to take off into space. I purchased the bundle with MW Remastered and I absolutely love it! It's just so nice to play an old COD on current consoles and engage in nostalgia. It's quite striking how different these two games play, even though they may look similar. I can't really say whether I prefer the old COD or the new one. I just like them both and each can be better than the other, depends on how you look at it. It's just sad that if people simply don't like shooters or COD that they rate this game low.

When comparing this to the impressive amount of fun and enjoyable shooters in 2016, this Call of Duty seems to really struggle to stand out among them, despite the fact that it has the biggest name in videogames right now plastered on it, which is why I will be comparing all the elements of this game to other games and talking about why this Infinite Warfare is worse. In terms of story, this game is hopelessly outmatched by the silly action movie fun of Titanfall 2. While Titanfall 2 uses its ridiculous premise to its advantage and tells a story that just wants to make the player have a good time, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare struggles with its own tonal consistency. For example, the game tries to portray the antagonists as in a gray area between good and evil, but instead of having a main villain that compliments these features, they just made a black and white simply evil villain. In terms of mechanics, DOOM crushes Infinite Warfare every time. Infinite Warfare made some interesting movement mechanics that could work if they were implemented well into the story and missions, but instead of doing that, the game doesn't really take advantage of them by using them to create unique level design layout, or do anything with them besides include them. DOOM, on the other hand, uses each of its mechanics to create the feeling of stomping through hell annihilating everything in your path. If the player was forced to stop every few seconds to hide behind cover it wouldn't feel like a rampage, and the game wouldn't have the same sense of power as it does by using the glory kills to keep the player constantly moving forward and smashing everything. Not to mention that in DOOM there are actual variety in environments and level layout, instead of in Infinite Warfare where only one mission does anything remotely interesting in terms of variety, and it's Operation: Dark Quarry. I like it because the enemies fight differently than all other enemies in the game. Instead of shooting from a distance, they constantly run at the player, which means that this mission involves learning how the enemies attack before getting good enough to effectively destroy them. The space combat in Infinite Warfare is fine, but gets stale quick and this is an issue because a lot of the game is spent in these ships.

That was the first Mission. Okay, it was okay, I didn't expect much but it got worse. The driving parts are so fast, its like playing Need For Speed. And then the tankdriving... Horrible, especialy when my little Sherman with his short 75mm gun takes out multiple Panzer 4s and a freaking Kingtiger... What a laugh! Over alll it was a really nice showcase of how freaking great the americans where and that they won the war ALONE. Well, no... for me it's just bitter how they try to tell this story. I am german and yes, my great grandfathers fought in this terrible war. I know a lot about it. The Story forgot the Brits and Canadians, even on the overview Map there where no signs of them, STUPID. The resistance part of the game was a bit new and gave a new perspective but here was also nearly everything wrong. First i thought the Voiceacting was cool, all Germans speak perfekt german and the conversations made sense but then there was this one offizier that name i forgot... He spokes very bad german with a stupid acsent... and the game lost me once again. So the unrealistic story went on and I played through.... but then there was the part i was most disappointed: The scene at the end with the KZ... Just some random buildings, two hanging copses, some corpses on the ground... nothing really shocking nd tht is the problem. If yo visit a real memorial site of a KZ and you read all the history and look at the pictures you can't sleep for days, thats how horrific it really is and this game needet to tell this story better, more shocking. But no, it looks like a random prison with some people who might have died. Seriously? The developers didn't take the time for research, everything is wrong about it.

It felt like I was playing Call of Duty 2 or 3, and while I enjoyed some of the nostalgia and simplicity of it all, I was constantly reminding myself that this was a 2017 release that cost millions of dollars to make and promised a return to form while pushing boundaries, and the game failed to deliver in that regard. Worse still, where the game goes over-the-top with it are the most immersion-breaking parts of the story. There's seriously a scene where you sneak into a Nazi camp with suppressed SMG's ( the stealth sequences are terrible, by the way) and later in that same level, you chase a train and flip your vehicle sideways in front of it and end up grinding against the train before it eventually derails and you fly out of your jeep. A lot of the game doesn't feel like WWII and instead feels like a weird pseudo-WWII. Honestly, the only way I got through it and found myself having fun was by acting like it was Inglorious Basterds The Game. Seriously guys, take this campaign with a grain of salt and try to treat it like a war movie and just enjoy the ride because if you're looking for a realistic or immersive experience, you won't find it here. It's a good campaign, but only if you appreciate it with the right mindset. If you're like me and you loved World at War, this game's campaign won't be dethroning it. Multiplayer made me keep reminding myself that, once again, this was a multi-million dollar franchise because the multiplayer is about as basic as it gets. You get all the modes that come in traditional CoD fare with a few additions like the War mode which really just boils down to, \"Defenders camp and attackers shove their bodies into objectives and ruin their K/D.\" But the maps are basic, bland, and uninspired and the weapon selection is mostly acceptable at best. Again, this multiplayer is easily 10x better than Infinite Warfare's, but that's barely saying anything. I truly felt like I was playing a lesser shooter made by a smaller developer instead of a powerhouse franchise. It's pitiful, actually. The zombies, however, is something I enjoy for the most part. It's familiar enough to draw me in, yet different enough to feel unique. The map is huge, the zombies have different movement patterns than the other CoD games, there's different zombie types, and catalogued objectives that guide you on a path. I feel like this game gives you the tools to last longer and it feels like the devs want you to survive and see it through if you can figure out what you're doing. There's a story there, and it peaks your interest. But one of the areas this game stumbles in is the accuracy department. Suppressed weapons, manually reloading M1 Garands, red dot sights, incendiary bullets, and NO FREAKING SWASTIKAS in multiplayer really hold this game back. Because Nazi zombies with a bunch of iron crosses draped on everything doesn't look anywhere near as sinister as it should. In fact, just to mock the absurdity of this game's political correctness, my multiplayer soldier is a black woman who's calling card is Normandy beach with a gay pride flag raised on it. Seriously. These are things Sledgehammer put in their game about WWII, folks. And speaking of things put in the game, the microtransactions and the season pass are back and just as prevalent as ever, and given the fact that Activision recently patented methods to shove them down our throats even more, it seems that they're going to be content to alienate their fans and bleed whoever's left dry until the cash cow can't be milked any further. At the end of the day, Call of Duty WWII is strictly average in every way. It's by no means a terrible game, but it never comes close to greatness, either. This will be a game relegated to the dead center of every CoD ranking list, and that's where it belongs. If you need to wash the taste of Infinite Warfare out of your mouth and want that CoD experience you can't get elsewhere, this game is for you. As for me, this is a game I'd buy on sale for about 20 bucks because that's all I feel it's worth. But if you're looking for historical shooters, Battlefield 1 is a much better game and there are plenty of other first-person shooters on the market that outclass this one. Like I said, it's a C- grade from a failing student. It's good compared to its last few outings alone, and that's not saying much."], ["DayFul", "User", "0", "I skipped infinite warfare due to being tired of the tiny maps, Ultra low ttk and terrible connectivity that has been a hallmark of recent COD games.

I have owned systems and played games that some may have never seen or even heard of. Games have been a major part of my life since I was a child throwing tantrums over Thrillas Surf and Safari. I have played many COD titles and always at least tried to remain a loyalist. It wasn't until the N64 era that I really dug into the FPS genre with classic titles like Goldeneye and Perfect Dark. Call of Duty launched (many years later), and wow what a fantastic beginning to a franchise! Epic multiplayer and short yet powerful campaigns. It almost seemed like it would never stop either, every year a new COD would launch and it was a must have! Suddenly it seemed like it started to falter. It went from a perspective I understood to double jumping and running along the walls; flying through the air with jet packs.. Needless to say I wasn't much of a fan and only bought the new franchise titles when they were on sale or at a killer discount. Even then... After playing Ghosts, I realized the franchise had completely fallen into disarray and I converted my attention more into the battlefield franchise. I played Infinite Warfare with a friend and almost couldn't physically do it. Another COD failure. I should have known better. Then alas! A \"boots on the ground\" Call of Duty! Could this be a rebirth of a once great franchise!? Could this be another great title; reminiscent of the original Black Ops 1?? How exciting! I had to go out and get it on launch day! Nov 3rd! I had high hopes and hadn't bought a COD title in years. I dove right into multiplayer and tested every available weapon I could. It had a renewed feeling and I was excited. For 20 minutes. Then the endorphins settled and I took note to aspects of the game that became more evident. Like why do I keep playing the same 2 or 3 maps over and over? why is everyone running around with SMGs? Why is every map so small and contained? I quickly started to feel like I spent 59.99 for a few hours of enjoyment, and that afterwards, this game would sit on the shelf with the dozen or so other titles I have that rarely played in the last 6 months or so, and as I sit here typing, that is where CODWW2 sits. In the case, on my shelf, next to The Wolf Among Us. I anticipate that is where it will stay, while Battlefield 1 sits pretty in my Playstation.

I haven't played a call of duty game since black ops 2, so it's been a good bit since I've played one of these games so this review is coming from someone with an outside perspective.  Playing this game after a long break from the series, it still feels very much the same as when I stopped playing the series. The changes in multiplayer feel very minor, as the experience felt about the same to me as it has always been. The only changes to multiplayer that I really noticed is that there's a hub area in multiplayer that you're in before going into a match and that transitioning to new matches feels a lot more seamless than it used to. However, the changes that were made are probably feel a lot more important to a hardcore call of duty fan than it was to me. The zombies mode in the game is very fun to play with friends. I didn't play too much of it, but the time I had with it was fun and I was surprised that they actually made a campaign out of it. The strongest part of Call of Duty WW2 to me was the main campaign. It feels like the Call of Duty campaigns fly under the radar, which I've always felt is unfortunate. Strange as it may sound, I think that the Call of Duty campaigns can be compared to the Marvel films. They feel like pretty standard cookie cutter stories that always play it pretty safe, but the experience is usually a good time and has characters you can feel attached to. Call of Duty WW2 uses this format as well, and it's probably one of the best campaigns in the entire series. It gives off a Saving Private Ryan kind of vibe, and includes many characters that you actually become attached to and care about what happens to them. The main protagonist Robert \"Red\" Daniels is one of the more interesting characters, who has a good backstory and his chemistry with the rest of the cast helps make the story remain engaging. Overall, Call of Duty WW2 feels like the same Call of Duty that we've always known  it to be. The multiplayer feels the same as it did when I played it many years ago, as does almost every other area. If you are a Call of Duty fan who plays the game every year, you won't need my recommendation because Call of Duty fans will buy the game no matter what.

However, where CoD WWII stumbled the most is in its scale. The campaign has its moments and ends up being a good reason to pick up Call of Duty to begin with but its multiplayer pairing is not so fortunate. Much of WWII's multiplayer feels heavily rehashed from previous games, adding little new to spice up the formula. Maps are typically dense and lead to more encounters between players but that doesn't translate to more fun. Often times, players can be cornered into spawn kill/deaths, especially if an opposing team knows where to stop pressing to keep the predictable computing from spawn-swapping. It really bugs me that no Activision title with the CoD moniker has fixed this problem after years of abuse. Nazi Zombies always has its fun moments, bringing a more visceral experience to the shooter. It's clear to me that this game mode is the only aspect that delivers time after time. It shows complexity, strategic thinking, and white-knuckle experiences because of how unpredictable the game mode can be. Good on Sledgehammer for keeping this part of the game fun and interesting. However, outside of an OK campaign, there isn't much to love here. Call of Duty continues to be nothing more than a re-skinned version of itself, year after year. This is a huge irritation as Call of Duty is begging to break out of its shell.

All the characters in this game have very unique personalities that should have been shown off more. One complaint I have about this game is the game options. Before you start a game there are a list of options. In these game options you can change what the score is to win. For whatever reason, this score starts at a default value and will not go lower, only higher. With the default setting, most games take about 4 minutes.

Your characters level up quite frequently perhaps too frequently because after ever battle somebody in your party has leveled up and you got skill points to spend.

This game focuses purely on platforming, with a variety of 3D linear and side scrolling levels. Crash 2 and especially 3 have more driving/flying/swimming levels that focus less on platforming and more on movement. You also have a slide mechanic, and in Crash 3 you earn a double jump and other features that make the games easier than the first. The graphics, sound effects, and music overall are really great. They are pretty faithful to the originals and create a really great atmosphere when playing the games. The main issues come from the outdated controls.

Joined by the CPU Candidates, you'll fight in 4-person real-time brawls, unleash devastating Awakening Skills, customize with tons of cosmetic accessories, and even play online with others!", "reviews": [["Digitally Downloaded", "Critic", "90", "So it\u2019s deliberately bad, then. And as a bit of irony, it\u2019s so utterly delightful for that. I\u2019d never recommend that someone looking for a genuine MMO or MMO-like experience actually play this - you\u2019ve got Final Fantasy XIV for that - but for silly, ridiculous, self-deprecating humour, backed by gorgeous character and environment art, and a fast, fluid, and genuinely entertaining combat system, I\u2019ve had such a good time with Cyberdimension Neptunia that I can\u2019t help but love it."], ["DualShockers", "Critic", "80", "A slice of life approach to storytelling with a cast of characters that I\u2019ve had the honor to see evolve over the past seven years. Aside from taking on missions and wrecking thousands of enemies, the story and characters drive this game forward which is important because there is a lot of story here."], ["Hardcore Gamer", "Critic", "80", "Speaking personally, Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online was a tonic I needed that arrived at just the right time. It\u2019s pure, cheerful escapism that only wants to be fun for the player. Some might say that it tries too hard and this outing won\u2019t change any minds. Fans will tell you that the damnable earnestness of it all lifts it up. This is also the first time that the series has managed to feel great in a true action form. Perfectly hitting every note that makes this series so popular, fans of Neptunia will have plenty to do with 4 Goddesses Online and those curious about the series should start here."], ["RPG Fan", "Critic", "74", "If you don't already like the Neptunia series, you will probably be hard-pressed to like this game. It's a pretty typical action RPG, with a ho-hum story. However, as a Neptunia fan, this game does what the Neptunia series is best at: having fun with its cast of characters. For once, these characters are taking a relaxing break from the toils of their daily life and not worrying about getting thrown out of their country by evil forces or thinking about how to best serve their citizens. Gaming has always been one of the great pillars of the Neptunia series. It's just a shame the gameplay in this particular game isn't the best."], ["Video Chums", "Critic", "74", "If you're in the market for a mindless hack and slash action RPG with endearing characters and plenty of cheeky moments then Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online is sure to satisfy. Just don't expect the fun to last very long."], ["Everyeye.it", "Critic", "73", "The story is still affected by the usual long-winded dialogues that could bore players less accustomed to reading excessive texts, but the witty and crazy gags, the quotes to distinguished franchises, and an exquisitely frenetic combat system will delight any lover of videogames of Japanese production."], ["Attack of the Fanboy", "Critic", "70", "Though Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online stands as the strongest spin-off in the series, its shallow combat and uninspired boss fights will likely prevent it from appealing to all but the most hardcore of Neptunia and action RPG enthusiasts."], ["GamingTrend", "Critic", "70", "Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online is the MMO experience you\u2019ve been dreaming of for Neptune and her friends, though it does come with a lot of shortcomings. The game does a novel job of producing a quick paced action JRPG that looks and feels incredibly like an MMORPG in almost every way, down to a text chat box. There are some issues with combat and that drags the experience down. Despite that, the game provides a fun and basic online mission mode, and provides a lot of fun and fast paced action in a pretty package."], ["RPG Site", "Critic", "70", "If you\u2019re willing to put up with the rather uninspiring combat and a few frustrating design decisions, Cyberdimension Neptunia is an achievement for the franchise. Thanks to its fast-paced combat and eye-pleasing splendor, this is one niche JRPG fans will love. For the rest, it may take more convincing from the developers."], ["TheSixthAxis", "Critic", "60", "I was so ready for an action RPG entry in the Neptunia series to come along and scratch my itch, but instead it puked on my lap and barely touched the itch. I had so much fun with the story and characters, but with better combat and more consistent performance, this game could\u2019ve been something special."], ["PlayStation LifeStyle", "Critic", "60", "A perfectly serviceable action RPG. That might not sound like a ringing endorsement, but for folks who are looking for a bit of mindless, distracting entertainment (and who couldn\u2019t use that with all the things going on in the world today?), Tamsoft\u2019s latest foray into this goofy game industry parody should fit the bill nicely."], ["Gaming Age", "Critic", "50", "The battles here are repetitive and uninspired. Again, depending on your feelings towards the series\u2019 other games, you may think that\u2019s nothing new, but here it just feels much more noticeably bland. It never connects. MMOs and faux-MMOs are ripe for parody, which you\u2019d think would make them ideal targets for Hyperdimension Neptunia\u2019s brand of game-centric humour, but as Cyberdimension Neptunia shows, it\u2019s apparently harder than it looks."], ["mymooo3", "User", "8", "If you read Mitcher78's review of 0/10 then  you know that person lying because you dont need to create an account on four goddesses online, he thought it was an actual MMO, he obviously didnt play the game and he reviews it? How dumb just to give a zero rating. Mitcher, you're  the reason why metacritic is full of cancer. Do you feel stupid now after knowing you don't need an account?"], ["vahn", "User", "6", "I like neptunia...I'm not a fan but I do like their games: they're funny and keep me entertained for as much as I need (usually 30 hours or so) and this game is no difference from the rest."], ["Maikel_12", "User", "10", "One of the best neptunia game, I Love It! Nice graphics, good story, CG ilustrations amazing, i hope IF keep make Neptunia Series Games, Nep Nep for all"], ["MetaRookie", "User", "10", "So far one of the best Neptunia games. I still wouldn't recommend this over VII, unless you don't like turn-based games. However, this game clearly shows the improvement the series had so far. The game now runs on UR4 with a pretty constant framerate, though it has some memory leaks that will cause the frame rate to drop and eventually the whole game to crash. But besides that, I have no complains."], ["RaySerBoss", "User", "10", "First of all if you are a Neptune fan this title is a must buy and you will not be disappointed, and if you do not follow it or want to start it, it is a highly recommended game to enter the series (although I recommend playing the main line first) in this game they make an introduction of the characters and is not so difficult to pick up the pace, is one of the best spin off of the series if not the best, has an accessible and fun gameplay with a level of complexity that increases depending on how deep you want to reach. It has a story that as is customary in the series fulfills its task of entertaining and pulling one smile in your face, is not an epic and legendary story, but of course this is very good. In technical matters this game makes good use of the UE4 showing a great evolution compared to other games of the saga. So far in places with large number of enemies I have not seen at any time in which affect the fps. It has a very fun multiplayer where you can perform quests with up to 3 people. The best sections of this game are the artistic and the sonorous 10/10 a demonstration that these people know what it does, a design of scenarios and characters well above many other games today. The only issue that i encounter is the delay in launching between the different regions, but this does not demerit a great game."], ["mitcher78", "User", "2", "Ok, I have created an account just to say: WHAAAT??? Seriously? This game is one of the biggest pieces of crap that I have played in my whole life. Repetitive, boring, absurd, with PS2 graphics and terrible gameplay. Stay away!"], ["DanMaximo", "User", "8", "Lo cierto es que el juego es l\u00f3gico que este mas echo para jugar on line ( cosa que yo no he echo) Pero he terminado el juego a un  jugador y me parece que es muy divertido de jugarse. Ademas de que con 12 personajes completamente diferentes el juego es muy variado. Y visualmente aunque no es un portento tiene un color muy agradable de ver y con mucha vida."], ["Powermario0", "User", "9", "This is the best Neptunia game so far. First of all gameplay is good, graphics are better than any other Neptunia game and story is interesting. Game balance is overall very good."], ["RepentantSky", "User", "4", "This game is bad. There's no two ways about, it's the worst in the entire series. It's not a good starting point for anyone either. The point of the game is obviously to make fun of SAO, and it gets two point for that, but the other two points only come because the game actually looks pretty good and it functions, because no game that functions deserves a zero. If I did believe that, this game would be a three, because it's just awful. The gameplay is more simple than any of the other action rpgs in the series, and the online servers are total garbage. The lag makes them entirely unplayable. I platinumed this game, but it's one of those where I almost feel guilty about it, because it's so easy to get it, it's hardly worth it. The game is also incredibly short, like shorter than any SAO game I've ever played. I got the platinum in four days and about 25 hours of gameplay. It's really that easy, as is the rest of the game. If the game was meant to be terrible, that would be one thing, but no game should try so hard to be meta that it actually makes the game worse for anyone who buys it, and that's exactly what this game is. I got it for 20 dollars on sale, and I still don't think it's worth it."]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/2f12c4eb3b66c36bbaf50af2be7fcd47.jpg"}
