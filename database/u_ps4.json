There are maybe about 10 maps, give or take, and there are only two main game modes: one life or mixed objectives mode. In one life, you have one life. Self explanatory, yes, but all online modes are conducted in a three versus three format, where the first team to take 3 wins first gets the victory. If there happens to be a draw in a particular round, then both teams are awarded a half a point. So, if both teams win 2 rounds and then there's a draw, then the score would be 2.5 to 2.5. In mixed objectives mode, there are many different game types that are shuffled about to determine a victor. Just think of your typical competitive shooters.

This game is Uncharted, it's not some new IP, and so of course it's going to be like the older games, but there's so much more new stuff added to keep it refreshing. Things such as the hook mechanic, the sliding mechanic, the new stealth system, and more. The AI is also better than ever. In older Uncharted games, when you got spotted, the AI wouldn't stop unless you were dead or they were dead. Once they saw you, they basically fixated on you, even if you were out of their sight. In this game, the AI is much different than that. There's three different \"modes\" of the AI: passive, neutral, and aggressive. Passive shows up above an enemy when you're out in the open and there's a great chance of them spotting you. Neutral is when they think they've spotted you, but you've obstructed their visual with you and then they go and investigate. And aggressive is when they start shooting at you after spotting you. This adds a much more realistic taste to the game that is done very well. The shooting is as fun as ever as well. They've also added another new mechanic...vehicles. Now, in the game, you can drive cars and boats, which, while it may not seem groundbreaking, is just a nice touch. The game also borrowed a bunch of things from The Last of Us, a game also developed by Naughty Dog in 2013. Things such as the side conversations, and the new hidden things such as documents that you can discover, look at and read. Again, while it may not seem groundbreaking, it's a nice touch. Another cool thing is that, when Nate, Sam, and Sully are having a conversation, if you do anything to stop the conversation (i.e. driving through a waterfall or a shootout) they'll say something like, \"wait, what were we talking about\" and they'll just pick up the conversation from there. It's that realistic, and the detail is perfect. And the story, oh, the story. It's marvelous! The end of Uncharted 3 kind of left you for a yearning to find out what happened after the seemingly abrupt ending. Well, I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say, it's great to find out what happened, and the story is anything that you would expect from Uncharted, but even better. It's so much more fleshed out. Anyways, whether you're a big fan of the series, whether this is your first game, or whether you don't even have a PS4, you NEED to pick up this game. The $60 price tag is way worth it in the long run (though, I would recommend playing the first 3 games just so you know most of the characters and what's going on). It's that good. I'm about halfway through the game and I'm loving it. I haven't played much multiplayer (though I did participate in the open-beta) and let's just say that it's not tacked on and is very much fun... : )"], ["elGoddamnDorado", "User", "10", "you really no they are quicly made accounts just to downvote Uncharted 4 when all of the negative reviewers have not reviewd anything else at all and just recently made their account, or just gave one other rating on a nintendo or xbox game. ie one reviewer reviewed only 2 things, 10/10 for Star fox zero and 0/10 for Uncharted 4.

I've been a huge Uncharted fan since I first bought Uncharted: Drake's Fortune at age 10. Had known nothing about the game, but I had the birthday money to buy me a game or two and Drake's Fortune happened to be that game and was the first game I purchased for the PS3. It was incredible. 2 years later, Uncharted 2, absolutely incredible and my favorite of the three. I didn't appreciate the third one as much at the time, but as I played it recently on the Uncharted Collection to prepare myself for the fourth, I enjoyed it more. Now, for what we've been waiting for. Uncharted 4: A Thief's End has kept my mouth open in awe with the three hours of playthrough. Now, I'm only on the 6th chapter of the game, so this review may change, but there hasn't been a moment where I wanted to put the controller down. I almost called in to say I was sick. Its really an incredible experience. Its got me emotionally drawn. Now, know that I've had such a crazy passion for these games and I cherish the franchise and Naughty Dog more than anything, since Jak and Daxter and Crash. This game isn't a game you should give such a low score. It really isn't. Its physically impossible for the game to get at least lower than a 6. Its graphics are incredible. I don't use Photo Mode often, but, you're gonna have to. The characters and location look incredible. 103 people so far have given the game negative scores, yet 3 have wrote reviews? This game, to me, is an absolute masterpiece. The Last of Us has been my favorite game since 2013, but Uncharted 4 is coming up close. I've enjoyed the hell out of it and I enjoy the amount of care and hardwork the employees at Naughty Dog put into their games to make an outstanding experience. Most people claim that the beginning was a little slow. I didn't think so. **** was happening all over the place. I say you should buy it. You shouldn't be baseing you views on the amount of negative distribution when only 3 have to say something about it, and even then, what they have to say is utterly stupid. Naughty Dog has never upset. I love the game so far. I love everything about it. You should probably consider buying it. Also, Multiplayer is pretty damn neat too.

Maybe even the best game on any modern console. The motion capture is the best I have seen in any game, it feels like real people having real conversations, who is being brought to life by Nolan North and his fellow actor friends. The game play is, to put it simply, fun. From shooting enemies with a range of different weapons to swinging from ledge to ledge with a rope, the game is never a bore. Naughty Dog has also in it's latest release shown us just what the console are capable of and has raised the bar for future video games to come.

Uncharted 4 has by far the best and most satisfying gunplay out of this series, hands down. Uncharted 4 has the best level design and stealth during combat sections in this series, hands down. It also has the best multiplayer this series ever has (imo) hands down. These four concepts are perfect in this game, Naughty Dog really refined the gunplay and gameplay in this game nicely. The characters in this game are the same loveable bunch from previous uncharted, except for Sam; and this is where the hiccups begin for this game. You stick with Sam for like 75% of this game, and his character just wasn't very interesting, I didn't care for him. In a game where story rules all, having a character that's generic and rather predictable takes away from game a lot. The villains are also meh in this game, without trying to spoil anything the twist in the story was disappointing and rather predictable. Overall the story teeter'd from predictable to good for me personally, but I did enjoyed the ending. The gameplay overall was pretty good, I loved the open-linear world, it helped added oomph to the gamelength, and most locations were interesting and treasure hunting was great. The combat sections were amazing, I loved the level designs of it, you can approach from so many angles and directions it was very fun, the stealth was a welcome addition (more optiions is never a bad thing). The guns are less wonky, and enemies are less bullet sponges, just overall amazing. The only parts I didn't like was that the game's pacing can get pretty slow, it's borderline walking (or climbing) simulator for major chunks of this game. This wouldn't had been a problem had the game's story was amazing, but it was good and nothing more. The set action pieces for uncharted (it's trademark imo) is pretty good (would've been better had it not been spoiled by game trailers). Overall I did think the game was really good, add in the fun and tactical multiplayer and this is certainly a day one buy with great longevity.  9.0/10.

Great graphics and amazing skin textures and facial expressions, and generally immaculate attention to detail in and out of cutscenes, so much so that you almost don't notice their seamless transitions, also thanks to the absence of any loading screens. Gameplay however, suffered from uninteresting and really tedious platforming that sees Nathan making it onto the next path by the skin of his teeth dozens of times, to the point where it gets repetitive and disappointingly predictable. It's fun and looks great, above all when you take a moment to absorb it all with the other characters from a panoramic cliffpoint or tall building, or even when you're jumping from collapsing bridges and four hundred year old towers, but after a while it loses it's lustre and it just becomes a rinse and repeat cycle. Shootouts and encounters are still heaps fun and you can approach it stealthly or guns blazing (although it's not recommended), and the puzzles are varied and challenging enough to be entertaining when they come around. The thing that yet again keeps it from being a masterpiece is its linearity in the gameplay and platforming. Getting from A to B always feels extremely on rails and set up, above all through its action sequences. Characters are well acted however, which keeps the mediocre plot above the water for most of the game, although it slightly loses itself in the third act, occasionally coming through a bit forced.

Through clever writing, fun characters, and a story that rejoices in a sense of globetrotting adventure, this game is extremely good at being entertaining until the very end. At its best, Uncharted 4 hits memorable story beats and follows it up with over-the-top fun and unique gun battles with unique hide-and-seek style mechanics. The worst moments, however, force the game to slow down to a crawl. For me, these were all during the climbing segments. These segments have never been, and will never be fun for me. Hitting one button to jump up a cliff is hardly anything more than a quick time event, but these climbing segments often go on for over a minute. I can understand how these are meant to slow down the pacing of the game, after all if the only moments in Uncharted 4 were the intense action sequences, the magic would ware off after a while. Yet that still doesn't excuse how boring the climbing is. Nothing happens during these segments. There's no sense of danger, and no skill necessary to progress. Noticeable improvements have been made in this aspect with the grappling hook, which adds a depth to climbing that isn't there in most other games with similar mechanics. However despite the promise of a more entertaining and complicated climbing system, there are very few areas that take advantage of the most interesting aspects of the grappling hook. I always wanted to string two to three grapples together, but the game only lets you do that a few times, which I found very disappointing. The story itself is extremely intriguing, and very clever at points, but there are points where the characters stop acting like real people for the sake of the plot, especially in the final chapters of the game. The levels, despite having a few branching paths, very rarely reward exploration with anything tangible, and as a result, some of them feel very restrictive. In this aspect, chapter four is the strongest the game has to offer. Every corner of the map has some sort of significance and exploration is always rewarded. Despite, in my opinion, having a few shortcomings, Uncharted 4 is still a very enjoyable experience.

The graphics are amazing, the voice acting is spot on--complete with all the charm and humor we've come to know and love from this series, and the gameplay is near perfect. There are a few minor gripes that I have: 1) the game, at times, tries to be like the Metal Gear games, whereas it almost seems like the game forces you to play stealthily in some sections. There are a given number of enemies in an area, and taking them out with stealth IS fun, but if they spot you all of a sudden dozens of them come out of the woodwork. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with white-knuckle shootouts, but it can be a bit frustrating at times, 2) there are certain times where the graphics CAN be a bit blurry. It's nothing major, and maybe it's intentional, but it was a little immersion breaking for me.

It is clear that Naughty Dog has taken all of the lessons they learned from the first 3 Uncharted's and The Last Of Us and once again created a masterpiece for the PS4. Nathan Drake's final adventure is perhaps the most engaging and thought-provoking yet, thanks to excellent writing and performances. However, the real strength of Uncharted 4 is the way it is able to combine story and gameplay with such grace. The game can be a little too difficult at times and the climbing controls could be improved, but those concern easily faded away when I was given the choice to engage a situation with stealth or brute force in the game's much larger sandboxes, or when the banter between Nathan, Elena, Sully, or Nathan's brother, Sam put a smile on my face or brought me to edge of tears. While playing Uncharted 4's 12-14 hour story, I never wanted to put the controller down. It's a story about family, self-examination, and even storytelling itself. And to top it all off, there is an engaging and provocative multiplayer in the package as well, with intense gameplay and tons of unlocks.

Uncharted 4 has it all Graphics, sound, gameplay, Story and multiplayer are some of the best I've ever seen. This is without a doubt in my mind the best Uncharted ever and is exactly how the series should go out.  If you were worried this was a copy paste job from Uncharted 1-3 don't worry. Things like stealth, grappling hook, characters and back story make it feel fresh. The AI has been ramped up and is now much smarter than ever before. Fist fighting is mostly the same, but more realistic than ever. For example an enemy punched by a table will grab the table to push off of and there are little touches like this everywhere.

From Nate and Elena's cluttered home, full of interactive trinkets collected from previous adventures, to the wholly believable relationships with the other cast of characters (acted to absolute perfection), this game hits a more personal note than previous entries. Considering performance, the game is impeccable. The presentation, acting (again), score, and visuals are all some of the best I've ever witnessed in the medium. The only thing holding me from giving the game a 10 is its pacing. It's paced extremely well for the most part, but there are segments that can tend to drag a bit. This may be intentional, as Naughty Dog is obviously trying to convey a more reserved and reluctant hero.

The only other game in the series I played multiple times through was UC2 and this one was much more captivating.

Modern single player games need to have a balance of certain factors to achieve greatness in entertainment.  First, it needs to have a great story that satisfies both fans of its franchise, as well as new players.  Second, it needs to have exciting gameplay that requires quick thinking and fast reactions.  Third, it needs to have elements that involve critical thinking and takes more time and in depth concentration.  Fourth, it needs to balance these aspects in a fashion that keeps the game interesting, and doesn't make it feel repetitive and/or boring.  The Uncharted series has done this very well from the first game through the fourth.  The fourth and final installment, however, did something a little bit extra.  It finished the story and finished it well.  Stories that follow a central character have to reach an inevitable conclusion.  Unlike stories that follow broader socio-political concepts, which can change and adapt to continue on, stories based on a central character needs an end for audiences to be truly satisfied.  Uncharted 4 does this in spectacular fashion.  It includes chapters from the past that reveals the depth of the Nathan Drake character, allowing for greater character development than we've seen in previous titles.  The game also shows us how Nathan Drake has learned from his previous experiences, and applies that wisdom to finally (spoiler alert) let go of his wild ambitions for treasure and adventure, and to finally settle down with Elena.

When you finish it  you actually feel like that's how it was supposed to finish. There isn't a reason it shouldn't have finished like that. It's just amazing and the ending not only brings everything together but it shows that games can actually have sequels and it can be perfected. I haven't seen anything like this before. Fallout couldn't do it, batman couldn't do it. No game on/off the market could do what Uncharted 4 has done and I don't think any game ever will. TLOU was great but the only people you really pay attention to is Ellie and Joel. In this game you care about everyone. Henry Avery, Nathan drake, Elena, Sully, Sam, Charlie, Chloe, Rafe, Nadine. The fact that I actually remember the villans shows how amazing and how big of an impact this game actually made. You feel for every one of these characters and even if Henry Avery isn't physically in the game you still want more of that character and you actually want to discover the treasure and you actually want to keep on playing until you figure out what happens. In most games you probably want to play as the same character but do something totally different than what the story actually makes you do. In this game I felt hooked and I didn't want it to be another adventure and even though the ending was unpredictable I didn't feel like it was forced or like it didn't have to happen in all honesty i'm very excited that it did happen and it's probably one of the best endings to a SERIES in gaming history.

Uncharted 4, for me, is the most complete game in every aspect, impressive gameplay, a story that makes you want to play one more chapter just to know what happens next, all combined in a imersive world that offers you a huge variaty of ways to play the game, more than one single path that you need to follow to get from point A to B, you can climb, go with your vehicle or just run! I can't remember a game that made me forget everything around me and turn off the real world to be Nathan Drake... \" One Last Time! \" This game is at the same level of The Last Of Us! The best Uncharted ever made, even better then Among Thieves! I can't get that this is the end.. the last Uncharted ever made, but in one way, i'm glad that this is the last one. You wanna know why? Because it ended in the TOP like it deserves, the same end that The Last of Us had, that make some people beging for one more chapter, and another ones that prefer that it doesn't happen, just because it could destroy what that game ment for us.

The franchise never took itself seriously, it proudly reveled in its Indiana Jones pulp action vibe, it was like a comic brought to life with love and a hell of a lot of tongue in cheek. All that is pretty much gone in this one. Uncharted was a boyish larger-than-life fantasy and had a tone all of its own, and Druckmann's and Straley's version pretty much misses the mark for the most part. Yes, the acting is amazing as usual, but the tone's completely different once you look beneath the surface. Sure, the set pieces are there, the quips, the banter, the action - but now they are like they'd be in any movie these days. Same goes for the score: Greg Edmondson not only created three outstanding soundtracks and extremely catchy themes you just have to hum along, he wrote music that was unmistakably Uncharted in a nutshell. But he got the boot, too, because Druckmann and Straley wanted Henry Jackman. He certainly did a good job with the score for Uncharted 4, but this one sounds like any other action movie score.

Even little things like being able to double team a bad guy with the other characters when beating them down was awesome and the little side conversations you could have or not have like in the last of us were things I really appreciated and added to the emersion. despite all this, the biggest thing this game does right is the story, it is extremely emotionally investing, and I appreciate that they do this without being gloomy like so many other titles. there are so many games that try to provoke emotion by being dark and depressing that its refreshing to have a story that's actually very light hearted in tone but still hits you in the heart. not to say that aren't sad moments, this game focuses strongly on betrayal, obsession, and letting go but it still manages to keep you laughing and smiling most of the way through.

Like the other games in the series, it featured some of the natural faults of parkour controls (here's looking at you, Assassin's Creed) like Nathan not jumping to the handhold you want as well as the annoying typical Uncharted difficulty spike during the final chapters. The story was also somewhat predictable, even in a couple of its twists. However, the sheer excellence this game boasts in every other area is what earns that 10. The story, while predictable at times, is as fun as ever, and the introduction of Nathan's brother Sam is a fun change-up on the Nate/Sully pair. The performances and mo-cap work are as flawless as ever, and the actor's excellent performances really allow us to buy into the story. This also serves as a beautiful end to Nate's saga, with a truly unique epilogue. This is the closest a game has ever come to being full-blown cinema (at least in the games I've played). This is helped along by the absolutely stunning graphics. In 15 years of gaming, I don't think I ever let my mouth drop at visuals...until the opening sequences of Uncharted 4. Seriously, this is one of the most gorgeous and stunning games *ever*. The gameplay is tight and fun. Both stealth and brute force work equally well, but best in tandem. The set pieces are crazy as always, and the final boss battle was probably one of my favorites I've ever played. Last but not least, I've also really enjoyed diving into the multiplayer. Eschewing the traditional leveling system works well in this case, and the cosmetic bonuses are fun ways to utilize progression.

Every single item in the game is unlockable by simply playing.

Even below #1 despite the advancements since then.  When judged as a \"movie-game\" all 3 previous installments had a brisker pace and better encapsulated the identity of the series.  Uncharted 2 is the best TPS/action/story game this side of Resident Evil 4, and yet Uncharted in it's fourth iteration feels like a chore.  It feels like it was made by a different team entirely.  This is the sort of game I would have expected had Sony demanded another UC game that ND didn't want to do and they handed the reigns to a different studio.  One unanimous praise I'm hearing seems to be the graphics but I'm not even convinced the graphics have improved a ton since Uncharted 2.  Things are sharper and more detailed in the town settings, and some of the skyline/mountainous backdrops are superior to the previous games, but those scenes are not the entire game.  There's a lot in between that is quite bland.  Almost as if they spent too much time on certain sections and not enough on others.  I would have much rather they went for 60fps and dropped the visual fidelity.  But alas, ND has clearly chosen graphics over gameplay here, because if ND played this game along side any of the previous 3 they must have realized it was less fun moment-to-moment and kept tweaking until it was.  I've played the game twice now and it was better the second time around because I had a better understanding of the stealth and shooting mechanics throughout the entire experience, but the bland story, intermittent shooting and 30fps graphics all take their toll.

A mixture of aesthetically map and story design influence from the previous games; the plane, the boat, caves, water diving, stones, treasure collectibles etc. Nathan drake, Samuel Drake, and Victor Sullivan go on the hunt for Henry Avery\u2019s 400 million dollar lost pirate treasure, but first they must find the lost Island of Pirate utopia. The Game tells more narrative story, puzzle cyphering then actual action gameplay, however their is still a lot of action in the game just not as much Uncharted 2 Among Thieves and Uncharted 3 Drake\u2019s Deception. The Game is more in the likeness of Drake\u2019s Fortune when talking about mood for the game. With saying that their is a much more narrative story then Drake\u2019s fortune and other 2 releases which is a good thing. On the gameplay side the new aim lock target is very awesome, in which the cursor is bigger and more hardened  when locked and as usually lights up red when locked and ready for fire. The game also has picture mode so you as the player can now take in game framed pictures of Drake, even though we have the share factory on PS4 it\u2019s still a great feature by hitting down on the sticks and capturing to just share your photo instantly. The Maps are big ranging from 40 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes and the campaign has a prologue, 22 chapters, and a epilogue chapter going into the future years after the final chapter.

Animation is gorgeous, facial expression is amazing, and all the characters are love-able (villains included).

The amount of stuff you can do in the game is also outstanding, you can drive a boat, a jeep, can use a grappling hook to cimb up to places you could not before and of course treasure hunting is back as well. The epic set pieces and spectacular action scenes are here also, and as expected you will solve quite a few interesting puzzles as well. Multiplayer has a bigger focus this time around, and it is a lot of fun. The online battles are always action packed and the level designs are extremely well done.

Game Of The Year, nod doubt!!!"], ["Zidane_Mina", "User", "10", "Uncharted 4 sticks with the proven formula that has made the franchise shine amonst many other games. Gameplay wise it does not take any risks at all, but the once solid gameplay mechanics are polished beyond perfection this time arround. Shooting mechanics are improved, fire arms feel realistic, cover system is more reliable this time arround, climbing and jumping feel more responsive and natural. Uncharted 4 introduces a hook, which leads to some fantastic showcase of Nathan Drake's dexterity, and can be used in combat aswell, making the movement across the battlefield feel natural and spectacular. Stealth mechanics where added in this new entry of the series, altough minimal and basic in functions, they add a layer of depth much needed in the series, and can make your work easier when facing large gropus of enemies, though stealth is not forced upon the player at any time, and there are no real punishments for screwing over a stealth aproach, which is a good thing in these series. Uncharted 4 also showcases semi open world enviroments in some of its chapters, and offer a variety of paths to travel into, which is a neat addition to the game, but nowhere as complex as a sandbox game, but its clear that wasn't the developer's intention here."], ["KevinHeryanto", "User", "10", "Uncharted 4 is simply the definition of a next-gen cinematic game.

The problem I find with these types of game set in real life is that Nathan Drake, Lara Croft or whatever protagonist it may be has to kill hundreds and hundreds of hench men which is kinda unbelievable, it also makes them seem like half- sociopaths for killing all these guys.. i mean i know they are 'bad', but still. At least in TLOU, they kill the infected, and in a post apocolyptic world everyone is desperate for survival, which leaves more varied enemies and also more strategy and different types of gameplay. They also arent forced to vary the gameplay by adding long platforming sequences. Even with a more fantasy type world like Batman  its more believable because hes batman and can use his gizmos and equipment, and well... he doesnt actually kill anymore.

The combat is really good and the guns have a level of recoil that is just right on the guns. Also, I especially like how you can use guns while swinging on a rope. It's so fun to just swing out from a tower or something at spray at some people. The bonuses you get after completing the game are a really cool addition to it as it adds a lot of replay-ability.

My problems with the game is that it is just so underwhelming. Once the credits rolled I looked back on my adventure, compared it against others of the series and felt hollow. The large scale ridiculous set pieces that the Uncharted series is known for are unfortunately sparse. As a result, it fizzles, instead of bangs. A damp squib. On top of this, the puzzles aren't nearly as well crafted, often only taking a small amount of thought to solve. Most of the game revolves around climbing, walking and shooting, which although was exciting in previous adventures, feels frankly dated. The storyline (no spoilers) does excel, due to Naughty Dog reigning it in a little. With the last of us Naughty Dog have seemed to really hone excellent characterisation and some more poignant, sentimental moments. The same applies here. Overall, the story is not quite as ridiculous as the other games.

And one thing I wish I was told before going down this path is to not do the first play-through on Crushing. It is not as rewarding to beat the game on the hardest possible difficulty on the first try as it is in other games. The reason for that is because there is one key elements that is removed in Crushing that is available otherwise. That feature is the stealth mode. In Crushing, stealth mode is almost useless many of the times. U4 makes stealth a bigger part of the core gameplay in comparison to previous tittles. You are still able to stealth through certain levels and be able to maybe kill a few guards before essentially being forced to go commando, but the ability for guards to notice you in Crushing is significantly easier and there is no detection meter nor marking capabilities. If you really care to stealth 100% of the time then you may, but it will take a lot of practice without the two features mentioned prior. Not only is it excrutiating to stealth on Crushing, but there is no real reward for doing so. The game does not even encourage stealth gameplay like others do. For example, you will never find a silenced weapon and there is no penalty for going guns blazing shortly after the encounter started Please heed my advice and enjoy the game on another difficulty before Crushing on your first play-through.

Many scenes are colorful and beautiful to stop and sightseeing for a while. The story is ok, not bad but not so good. If you watch a lot of action movies, you may be able to guess what is going to happen next. Nothing feels truly unique here (Tomb Raider or Last of us have better stories in my opinion)"], ["TheMetacritiqer", "User", "8", "It's hard to put words together on how impactful Uncharted has been. It's really over and it's tough to put away. But I like to remember the certainty of there being new, equally affecting experiences in the future. All our things used to not be there. Uncharted 2 was a very alluring prospect when it came to be. I trusted the praise of all the critics and fans. But it's not worth getting another console for one game. Not too long ago, I was at a friends house with a PS3. I searched through, and it was there(this is sounding like a 5th grade personal essay example. Difference is, I mean it). It felt surreal to have the opportunity to play it. Yet in a very real way I already experienced it. I held it in a high esteem for it's cinematic action that seemed to might even match that of the unparalleled Modern Warfare 2. I saw the E3 gameplay demos and read the reviews. I already had my opinion of Nathan Drake being a cocky protagonist that ignored the more recently realized moral aspects of killing. An EGM editor put it simply, that he is a mass murderer. But yeah, maybe saying \"sweet\" while grabbing an AK is just his easy-going self preservation. I managed to rush through a few chapters. I agree that it's 9 probably even 10 out of 10 material in 2009. Now it felt like a inoffensive run through of action and platforming mechanics and level design that Tomb Raider and others were happy to pick up. So when I recently bought a PS4, more in earnest of used games to play before the amazing looking upcoming exclusives, I wasn't really excited to play this game that was bundled in. Though right away, I was thankfully proven wrong. No, it didn't make any leap forwards in games like Spec Ops:The Lines crushing narrative or the incredible exploration of Skyrim. But the way Naughty Dog put it all together made it become a superior single player game. I still feel a little spoiled seeing the amazing graphics, which are combined with a more down to earth yet still stunning art style. The traversal mixed with open combat or  fast initiative taking stealth felt like a new progression of 3rd Person action. Even from the announcement trailer with Nathan coming to in a dark and quiet setting, the game seemed to be more reserved than in the past. It gave the impression that this wasn't essential canon or had anything truly new. But especially towards the end, it makes up with huge explosive sequences that take on a higher level of power with modern graphics. The pg-13 Spielberg/Pirates of the Caribbean tone pervades throughout the game and is as important as the use of the gun play. This really is what makes it stand out among the ultra violent comparatively grim crowd. And that is a great strength. However there are times when the dialogue detracts from the mystery or grandeur. It hard to get invested in the scene when Nathan continually exclaims \"Jesus!\" or makes a dumb observation of Avery's work I had to mute the dialogue while repeating tough sections, which helped me get through. It's all over but I'm certain we'll all remember Nathan's adventures. Uncharted's light hearted tone really stands out to me when so much else that I love to play feels harsh when compared. Not too bad, maybe I'll try to have Nathans outlook on things."], ["AndreRLZ", "User", "9", "Questo quarto capitolo della saga \u00e9 quello che da un senso a tutto e chiude (cos\u00ed si crede per ora) in maniera magistrale tutto l'arco narrativo, in quello che per me \u00e9 il migliore dei modi.

In Nathan Drake's final treasure hunt,  the story feels more emotional and personal than ever. The game mostly succeeds in telling this story; brilliant motion capture along with great voice acting make the game really shine. The main characters are really wel developed and engaging. The antagonist was, as per usual, forgettable. Naughty Dog seems to have difficulty finding Nathan's Joker. I wouldn't call it the best Uncharted in the series. The game can really slow down to a crawl at certain points. In The Last of Us, moments like these helped to tell the story of the world and also gave you a chance to gather supplies and what-not.  In Uncharted this felt different; exploration was only rewarded with collectibles or optional conversations that did not contribute to the story. Uncharted really shines in its action driven, almost on-rail, combat sequences. Even though the game was the longest Uncharted yet, the action sequences were sparse to say the least. Another issue that I had was that the game relied very heavily on stealth, making combat feel more Assassin's Creed than Uncharted. Especially on higher difficulty levels i found myself hiding in yet another patch of tall grass, waiting for a non suspecting thug to come by. One of Uncharted's strong points, as always, are the graphics. This is one of the most visually pleasing games on the PS4 out there today.

It is a game that may at first seem unnecessary, since Nathan Drake's story was already perfectly wrapped up.

Where Uncharted 4 made Nathan Drake feel like a real human being, The Lost Legacy does the same with Chloe and Nadine. From the beginning they are in conflict with one another and as the game progresses their developing relationship reveals new personalities gamers have never seen from these characters. Asav also is a great character, he is both menacing and has a lot of depth. He makes it very clear what he believes in. There is also another major character that comes as a really nice surprise later on in the game. This character contributes to some of the most entertaining moments in the game and helps add to the development of Chloe and Nadine's relationship. So while the story and characters take a lot of inspiration from Uncharted 4, the environments and set pieces take a lot of inspiration from Uncharted 2. Of course the core gameplay is the exact same as Uncharted 4, but the pacing and action is much faster. You really feel like you're on a mystical adventure as you are constantly being blown away by the amazing environments. The presentation of the game is superb, half the time it feels like I'm watching a blockbuster movie. And finally the game also has some unique twists that make the ending catch you by surprise.

Uncharted really surprised me and opened my mind to what experiences games can offer beyond just Mario levels of game play joy. Uncharted is not without flaws though, some levels make the actions necessary unclear, sometimes the combat is wonky and unfocused, and some levels do not feel interactive enough.

Here we have a game that was supposed to come out on the Playstation 3, and yet it is just now coming out as Playstation 4 exclusive. This is almost never a good sign, as games made under these conditions generally tend to have outdated graphics and sub-par gameplay. It leaves one wondering why and how the game got stuck in development hell. Topping it all off, Until Dawn is another \"movie game\", like The Order 1866; 1866 was met with a lot of mixed reviews, most less than flattering.  All that being said, I am a big fan of horror, and so I decided to preorder it anyway. I went to GameStop in the morning to pick up my copy. \"You look like you're here to pick up Madden\" the GameStop employee said as I walked up to the counter...; the horror had already begun.  Sports games!?  My worst nightmare! As soon as I got my copy of Until Dawn I fled GameStop, then rushed home to give it a try.  I delved into Until Dawn with an open mind, despite all of my worries.  Right off the bat my worries began to fade.  This doesn't look like a Playstation 3 game at all!  The graphics are phenomenal; some of the best I've seen.  The characters are very well rendered with superb acting behind them, and the storyline was immediately engaging. I braced myself for a long day of gaming.

It's intense, the decisions are even more intriguing, the characters begin as poorly written characters that are obviously a tribute to all typical horror movies, but they all grow so much on you, that it gets to the point where you're afraid to go forward because you don't want them to die.

As the game has a great deal of positives, there are negatives I experienced. The characters in the cast fell short for me, none of them were memorable to me and when(if) they died, I shrugged and kept on going. Another issue I had with the game was how badly the story was told, lore wise. The game would give you facts about an event and not five minutes later would completely refute it. I understand the mystery aspect but as an avid mystery genre fanatic, giving the player clues to connect and losing the relevance of key \"clues\" I found through the game was really irritating.

The setup is stereotypical in almost every way and it only gets more ridiculous towards the end of the game.

That's right, from one stereotypical movie trope to another. [spoilers end] The game makes you believe your choices ultimately matter, that they effect major events, when they just simply don't.

That's rare.\""], ["Garcessist", "User", "9", "So I had heard and seen a lot of people doing lets plays of this game and claiming it was the best scary adventure in a video game they had in a long time.  Now unfortunately I had a Xbox One and was really jealous of all the fun it seemed people were having with this game.  So I bit the bullet and bought a PS4 to play this game and various other titles.  But this was the main focus at the time for the PS4 purchase.  I had everything setup and friend coming over that weekend to do a play through of the game where we'd in a sense vote on different moments to try to really get it to be an interactive movie experience.  I must say from the start of the game it really sets the tone of being a teenager horror flick.  It pretty much throws you right into the game where you play the sister of a girl who gets a terrible prank played on her and it pretty much ends in disaster.  Then the game picks up a year later on the anniversary of the incident that killed the 2 sisters.  Right away the tone is very reminiscent of movies like Evil Dead Remake, Cabin in the Woods etc.  The game provides some pretty good frights and if playing with a group adds a fun dynamic on what conversation choices to make and which things to do or not do.  We all pretty much agreed that the scariest part of the game is the inter-chapter / episode interactions with Peter Stormare.  Every time you interact with him its fun to notice the changes to his office.  It's truly the creepiest part of the game.  I mean you get to pick that you are afraid of clowns and needles.  And then it translates itself into the game which is pretty fun.  The game does a fantastic job of building up the intensity during each episode and building up to pivotal points.  Just like a TV show you get those cliff hanger moments with one character then you quickly shift to another character at another place and take control.  Only to jump back to the cliff hanger moment in another episode.  The TV esque recap of the previously happened in between each episode adds a fun factor to the game.  I must say the first 60% of the game is awesome where it turned south for me is when you find out that everything was just a setup that the Brother of the deceased sisters created.  But then you discover that there are these monsters called the Windingos who are going around killing every one.  Similar to the movie Decent it really took a turn for the worse for me.  It's was a lot more fun for me to think there was a homicidal maniac chasing me than some zombie like cave dwellers.  With all that said I still played through the game a 2nd time to see if my prior choices mattered.  And I quickly realized it truly only matters from the stand point of keeping people alive or letting them die.  There is really not much as far as the actual game changing.  If you don't pick that you are afraid of clowns Josh will still have the clown mask.  The choices are a fun addition but when you realize they don't mean much it really takes away from the fun factor.  Still I really enjoyed my play through of Until Dawn and would highly recommend any one to play this because it really will appeal to all types of people this is more of a interactive movie / tv show than a video game.  Sort of like the old Dragon Lair / Space ace games just with more choices and variety."], ["PelucasMata", "User", "9", "Really great game!.

If it allowed me to climb up walls within the caves myself, or run and jump/crawl in real time, rather than pressing X or Y when prompted, I think I'd would've felt a lot more immersed.

Well, first of all is the re-playability. Once you know the story, there are no more surprises for next time around. That's not a bad thing on the whole - often with re-plays you already know the story. But the problem with Until Dawn is that you *expect* a different story given the 'Butterfly Effect' system.

Mask of Truth is a solid follow-up to Mask of Deception and a must-buy for all who enjoyed that game."], ["4Players.de", "Critic", "75", "Visually Mask of Truth is old-fashioned, but if you can look past that, the mixture of visual novel and strategic RPG has been enhanced or changed in just the right places."], ["Destructoid", "Critic", "75", "Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth's strengths aren't entirely justified by the sheer amount of time it would take to experience them in full, but anyone that's already willing to give it that time - or those who come in with properly calibrated expectations - will find an entertaining saga that's worth seeing through."], ["Cubed3", "Critic", "70", "It is difficult to pull off, but Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth has managed to both make a solid SRPG and visual novel in the same game. The world is interesting, and the characters are enjoyable to play as and to see the world with, even though sometimes it is too reliant on common tropes. The combat system also has depth to it with a lot of systems in place to reward those who think several turns in advance. The problem is that both aspects of the game are somewhat bloated. For fans of both genres this will not be obvious or even an issue at all, but for those who only likes the former or the latter, this might quickly make either feel like it's overstaying its welcome, in a good 80+ hours long game."], ["Atomix", "Critic", "70", "Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth is a great way to end one incredible and complex story like this one; it's guaranteed that fans will enjoy it the most. That being said, the game doesn't offer anything different from what we have seen in the past entries and still makes mistakes. Also, this is an aggressive game for newcomers."], ["PlayStation Country", "Critic", "70", "Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth closes out the visual novel's story for those who played Mask of Deception. I wouldn't recommend you start with this title but for those who are already invested know that this is a great continuation with some minor improvements."], ["Twinfinite", "Critic", "70", "While the story may take a bit of time to really get going, once it gets there it will grab a hold of your attention and refuse to let go. It is, ultimately, what the Utawarerumono series could have (and should have) been from the very start."], ["Video Chums", "Critic", "68", "Although Mask of Truth is certainly a better game than Mask of Deception, it unfortunately retains many of its flaws. That being said, fans of the previous game will have a wonderful time finally seeing the conclusion to this two-part adventure."], ["SpazioGames", "Critic", "65", "If you're a fan of visual novels and enjoy reading a story you can safely get Mask of Truth; the gamers who are actually looking for a challenge and don't care for the plot should probably look somewhere else instead."], ["The Games Machine", "Critic", "65", "Mask of Truth is a talkative interactive visual novel, with some bland tactical battles that break sometimes the flow of the story. If you are not scared by such a river of words, you could find in this new Utawarerumono enough reasons to reach the end. Otherwise, Fire Emblem and Disgaea are still out there, waiting for you."], ["GameSpew", "Critic", "60", "An unfortunately lengthy adventure with some fantastic characters, an intriguing narrative, and a simple but enjoyable strategic battle system. However, some abysmal design choices \u2013 namely, a lack of balance between visual novel and battle sections and a horrendous amount of bland filler content \u2013 severely tarnish the overall experience."], ["Playstation Universe", "Critic", "60", "Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth offers further content in the franchise. While the narrative base has an intrigue all its own, the vehicle by which it's received has flaws that can\u2019t be ignored. It\u2019s a visual novel with limited combat and some peculiar choices that somehow finds its way to a stellar conclusion."], ["IGN Spain", "Critic", "60", "Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth is, once again, a mediocre visual novel riddled with sexual (and barely related) content that makes it almost impossible to feel comfortable playing. Once again the combat system is forgotten by dozens of hours of dialogue making Mask of the Truth only accessible for true lovers of the franchise."], ["PlayStation LifeStyle", "Critic", "60", "Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth is an interesting hybrid of visual novel and strategy RPG that tilts, unfortunately for me, toward the former. As someone who didn\u2019t much understand the story thanks to its awkward retelling of the events of the previous two games (and who didn\u2019t enjoy the parts I did understand), I found the 1 to 2 hours of reading in between battles to be nearly unbearable."], ["snakekill321", "User", "10", "If you are playing Mask of Truth, it is probably because you were entranced by Mask of Deception, and I can honestly say to anyone on the fence: do it. If you dont like Slice of life fr the first half, watch the anime, itll be quicker, but for those looking for almost 100 hours of living in another world, feeling the whole story, and having the cathartic feeling when it ends, I recommend the whole series."], ["Falmung", "User", "9", "Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth is a visual novel that completes the trilogy of a game series whose release have been spread out between nearly 10 years in Japan. As part of a two part story it continues right where it left of from the previous game Mask of Deception."]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PlayStation Vita"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/f430059c60ed89af8146c97893bb18e3.jpg"}
