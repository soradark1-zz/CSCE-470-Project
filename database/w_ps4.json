Love the unique art design, and the game play was great fun. Rusty around some of the edges, but solid.

Id like to start of positively and say that Warframe is one of the shining examples of how to do F2P games without holding the player's wallet as a hostage. Warframe deftly avoids the trap of holding the player's wallet hostage in order to progress further into the game, unlike hundreds of games that use this model before it. That's not to say that you can't buy weapons or items to save time, but if you choose to do so, the player still has to do the work in order to make that weapon more powerful through repeated use and acquisition of mods to upgrade it, which cannot be side stepped by slipping a few dollars across the counter. The one exception here are the reactor and catalyst items. These outright double the mod capacity of any item they are usable on and essentially double that items level. I would consider this a negative if DE didn't always give these away to players every  2 weeks as well as they can be gotten as daily login rewards, alert mission rewards, quest rewards and just outright gifts for players. You can also buy  boosters for experience, resources, and in-game currency an can be purchased as well, but since it does not take long to get a weapon to its maximum level, it wont give you any sort of leg up on the competition, since this is primarily a PvE game. Even in the few PvP modes, since the primary way to gain power is through mods, which are consigned to enemy drops, you cannot buy any advantages there either and will have to settle for picking the appropriate Warframe and weapons for the job. Not to say the store is perfect, as there are a few flaws there. The real cash shop sells weapons, and they are hilariously overpriced compared. Simply put any player who learns enough about the game will know immediately to never buy weapons from the market and simply save your real cash for things like cosmetics, reactors/catalysts, and weapon/frame slots."], ["WarVenum", "User", "3", "The game is cool.

I wouldn't say impossibly hard, since they can be done with blind luck something like 25% of the time... but they are thoroughly obnoxious as all hell in ways they didn't need to be. Let's list of a couple of examples. First off you're often tasked with taking out a car. So you get into a car, chase the target down and..... you can change the traffic lights near him in hopes that he has an epileptic seizure when he sees red. You can't shoot from your car. If you get out to shoot, the target will escape and the mission will fail. So what you're left with is spending the next 35 minutes ramming into the enemy car hoping against hope that you will somehow succeed. Eventually you will, but did you have fun? No you didn't. It get's better. Often you are tasked to do this against convoys. In these missions you can intercept them and shoot them with say... a grenade launcher, and it's doable, if quite generic. But then the game tasks to take one or more people from the convoy *alive*. And now you're thinking \"okay, so I equip my tranquilizer darts or something like that right?\" Wrong. In order to take someone alive is to run into his di*k and hit him. While the rest of the convoy guns you down and kills you. If you stop to kill the rest of the convoy first, the targets will without fail escape. So you your only hope is to kamikaze the targets like an idiot and eventually succeed in your like nineteenth try after which you get to escape against impossibly fast pursuers and you've spent days on this mission. And it sure as all hell isn't fun. The game is filled with missions like this, that practically require you to have Saint's Row IV style superpowers like flight to get these slog missions done.... but you don't. The developers made Aiden Pierce an incapable protagonist who does not have the skills nor the equipment or health to take on these armed enemies.

These kinds of games have never really had any kind of great gameplay to them, but the thing that really turns me off about Watch Dogs is the same thing that turns me off about most games nowadays, and that is their predictability. When a company goes to make a game nowadays, they design their game in the spitting image of whatever game sells best in the same genre (for MMOs it's WoW, for FPS it's CoD, ect), gives it a different character/environment, and add a gimmick. The gimmick in this case obviously being the hacking. It's all very predictable and boring, and Watch Dogs does nothing but continue this trend of homogenization.

Even though it was delayed 6 months the game is still plagued with glitches and the graphics could greatly be improved. During gameplay many NPCs can be seen walking in to walls or other characters. The story has almost no point besides avenging your relatives death and Aiden Pearce has no personality unlike Trevor, Franklin, and Michael in GTA. The missions are mundane and pointless. At one point you were expected to find a suspected criminal using your smartphone and it turns out the person was invisible and only appeared after scanning every possible suspect twice. Another frustrating glitch was when you were supposed to chase down a guy.  I shot him in the back, but the game skipped to a cutscene saying he got away. On the opposite note I had to chase somebody in a car. He got away and a timer showed up stating how much time I had left to find him. the timer depleted and the guy got away,but the game skipped ahead to a scene after the car chase where I had to chase the man down on foot. The game feels very unpolished and has many other minor glitches besides the ones I mentioned. The controls of the game are also frustrating because there is not a button to jump freely. You can only jump by pressing circle when you are close to a climbable object and often have to wait for a prompt to show up before you can do it. The driving controls are also terrible. Hacking is a frustrating experience. Since there is only one button responsible for hacking the game often misreads what you want to hack. This would not be that bad if the game didn't end up blowing up explosives right next to you that lead to your death when you are trying to infiltrate a camera. The shooting mechanics are not great, but may be the best part of the game considering how terrible the entire thing is. Unlike in GTA free roaming is boring. The games fails to make a lively and exciting city. The police make driving a complete nuisance because they chase you for the slightest driving infractions,like speeding. GTA V is very smart to make the police somewhat slack in there enforcing. GTA allows you to fastly move from one location to another without the entire police department on your tail, but watch dogs turns these moments in to a high speed and hectic chase.

Watch Dogs is terrible game that lacks innovation, Graphics, an interesting story, and polished gameplay.

I personally found the way each car handles incredibly varied, and love the way that every vehicle can feel very different to another. It takes getting used to, and this is what I believe people complain about; vehicles can be difficult to drive at first, but you get the hang of it. You can't accelerate to a great velocity and not expect to run off the road when the steering gives out. I've got a feeling the people that complain about the driving have had too much hand holding in terms of ABS and vehicles that handle like they're made of cardboard, rather than metal. I'm sorry, but I found the handling incredibly intuitive, and those that found it difficult probably spent five minutes on the game, and then gave up. It's the only explanation I can come up with.

In no way does this game have bad graphics and to hate the game for not looking how you want it to is stupid and childish.

The world was bland and they promised smart ai that would interact with you but that was a complete lie. Gta 5's ai was worse then the ai in gta 4 and the multiplayer is a mess and is still missing stuff they promised back in September of 2013. This game just like all other games has its flaws too. The two biggest being the driving and the world invasion and how it punishes for turning off the ability for people to invade you. This game feels solid and so far its the best next gen game that has come out in my opinion.

I also love watching some random person running around looking for me when I'm sitting in a parked car right in front of them. \"Hey, dummy...I can almost smell your musk from here!\" It's hysterical to watch and I can feel their frustration from the other side of the country. Then, when they do discover you...it's on. I had one situation where I drove my car off a bridge, jumped out of the car in mid air and landed near a few docked boats. The guy chasing me followed my lead and a boat chase ensued that resulted in a hacked bridge and my getting shot to pieces. The multiplayer racing is also fun and totally unpredictable (but in a good way). The world is rediculously detailed and alive.

No, all these features are better in GTA V. Is it as fun as GTA V? Yes. This is Ubisoft's first foray into a modern open world on the scale of GTA IV / V and it's an admirable first step. The gun controls could be tighter - the game should have an auto-aim system with soft lock-on as with GTA V, but the existing controls are certainly decent, and when bullet time is enabled it does auto-lock onto heads when you aim close to them. The car controls are a let down but nowhere near as bad as some reviews claim; the first car you drive in the game at the end of the beginning tutorial sequence drives horribly, but immediately afterwards you can \"call in\" a car of your choice, and most handle much better. High-speed car chases require you to brake a bit instead of drifting round corners due to the heavy vehicle handling, but that's fine once you accept it's necessary. The joy of this game comes from the still-very-capable gunplay, gameplay, hacking, and a world as alive as GTA's - maybe not quite as many intriguing landmarks, but awesomely detailed, great people animations, and tons of mini-games and sidequests.

It's not the best game I've ever played but it's not even near the 0's and the 1's it's receiving from petty gamers. Overall it's a fun game with tons to do, I've had this game since release and i am not even near of finishing the main campaign as i always get sidetracked with all of the extra content. I see this as a good foundation as a ongoing series with some aspects that needs polishing. Graphics is good, not next gen but seeing as this is a cross-gen game i'm okay with that. Not that graphics matters that much versus game-play. Some game-play elements like effecting the game world gives this game a fresh new take at open worlds. The fun in causing mayhem by switching all streetlights to green or blowing up steam pipes at the right moment is priceless. The freedom in how to approach most missions is also a plus. You can either go all blazing or try a stealthy approach which is always my method. AI needs improvement but this is something most games needs and maybe we will see this further in this next generation. Other elements like the re-routing game-play when hacking could 've been more enjoyable then pressing X a bunch of times but the puzzle of how to unlock this game-play makes up for this. All in all it's a good game that deserves a 7 as minimum regardless of downgraded graphics or a more realistic car mechanics that is a bit more clunky then gamers are used to.

People also complain about the story in Watch Dogs, but to me personally the story is not lackluster at all. Besides, if you were to get bored from a typical story mission, you could drive 30 km in the other direction and rob a store.

Technically there is a lot to do in the game (including a decent multiplayer), but not much really arouses me personally to stick around for long. Now the cons: A horribly bland and boring/lifeless city with not much to see; sometimes I feel like this game would've been better off being a linear game as opposed to an open world game, as driving from point A to point B was such a chore to me. The side missions never really excited me, I just really stuck to the drinking mini game and crime prevention side quests and not much more. The driving was comically bad, especially the collisons to surroundings/ other cars; felt like the road was butter and I could crash into the back and somehow take no damage and end up sliding to the side of the car I just crashed into.

For instance, you will be being chased by some bad guys and have the ability to hack into and blow up steam pipes in the road and put up block barriers and such. But because they are behind chasing you, you can't really see exactly when to hack these things. Sometimes it will let you know when to do it and other times it won't. You  will often try to hack into and blow up some steam pipes in the road behind you, but will end up accidentally raising some block barriers in front of you or changing a set of traffic lights which leads to you crashing at high speeds.  The times when the game lets you know when to hack, the camera angle attempts to spin round to show you the bad guys being blown to bits, but it fails 99% of the time. The camera will spin round miss the action then spin back and put you off the game so you crash.

Some story aspects seemed rushed and at point I was scratching my head saying \"WHAT?!\" . The NPC randomly generated personality gave life to the random nobodies we are so used to seeing in open worlds. The side missions can be ignored as they do not really add to anything and will most likely end with you scratching your head saying \"What was the point of all this?\". The multiplayer on the other hand was a nice refreshing play style of cat and mouse with the addition of hacking. Without giving away the story, I will say Watch Dogs is worth the buy if you enjoy fun open world gameplay with a neat multiplayer and are ok with a story that you can pay less attention to, then Watch Dogs is a game I recommend with a rating of 7/10.

First off, the multiplayer is truly different and something to be hold. It consists of racing, hacking people who don't know you are in their game, and even a free play mode to just roam the huge and detailed city of Chicago and f*** s*** up together. The story is great, but a bit short for my taste. I got about 6 hours or so from story, and an extra 20+ hours from everything else. Aiden Pearce was a great protagonist, but like Conner from AC3, he was very boring and could have been much more than he was. The reason this game is an 8 instead of 10 is because the side content gets very boring. It's all the same. All criminal convoys and gang hideouts are the same, but they are still very fun. Fixer contracts are boring as hell. I'm not going to compare this game to GTA, because only bad reviewers compare one game to another to a similar one without focusing on the essentials. Also, there aren't all that many vehicles at all. There are only about 3 or 4 bikes, and cars are limited (but look sick).

I've never really experienced buyers remorse before I bought this game. I got the game earlier this week because I mistakenly hopped on board the hype train. I played the first one all the way through, and was sorely disappointed with the lack of features and content. It was this massive open world with not much to do. I mean, it has the (now) infamous Ubisoft style outposts and the gazillion collectibles the developer has become known for. The driving sucked, the story was cliche, and the missions were so repetitive. The gameplay could be summarized as \"bang, bang, vroom, vroom, hack.\" What did the sequel do about this? Sorta nothing. It copy and pasted the hacking style of gameplay, and didn't change anything about the shooting mechanics. Also, the driving is still garbage, and bikes are the dominant form of transportation. Bikes can literally break the pvp invasion mode. If the invader is caught in mid-hack, and gets on a bike, they can weave in and out of traffic, and they control better than any car in the game. Literally every car controls as if the road is ice. It's terrible and annoying. Just go play any good open world game with driving like GTA V or Sleeping Dogs and you will immediately understand what I mean. Why is Ubisoft getting away with selling  a mediocre game? It's practically the same as the first game, just with parkour and hipster clothing. In it's defense, San Francisco looks absolutely gorgeous and the parkour animations are very fluent. The game looks great, but that's about it. There are practically no changes to the multiplayer, which was one of the biggest problems with the first game. The E3 trailer for the first Watch Dogs had me hooked immediately. Seriously, go watch it, and you'll immediately understand why this game got so much hype. The multiplayer is what sold me on it. The ability to romp around Chicago with your buddies and hack your way through various missions seemed really fun, but that never existed. I don't know why, but there were no co-op missions in the game. The second game has these, but they are all just outposts. Why even give the missions different names if they are all just outposts? It's like Ubisoft put no effort into designing the \"fun\" aspect of the game. The design aspect is on point, and everything looks like it should, and the NPCs behave like they should, but it's not fun. It will get old very quickly. Every missions can be boiled to to \"drive here, infiltrate this, hack that, done.\" Play the game and tell me I'm wrong.This completely diminishes whatever replay value this game had. There is no story variety, and the characters are just unlikable. There is no depth to them. Marcus is just a hacker and hacks for the sake of hacking. Aidan at least had the revenge arch going for himself. That's the difference between Marcus and Aidan. Aidan has a purpose.

Though it did come out a day after I initially purchased a PS4, so I probably could have played any game and thought it was good at the time.  Regardless, Watch Dogs 2 does improve a lot of what the first game had.  Marcus is not the average grumpy anti-hero bent on revenge kind of character.  He is funny, a pop culture nerd, and black.  Pretty much the EXACT opposite of Aiden lol.  The game controls are super fluid.  Driving is pretty much the same as the first game, but imo that is a good thing.  I liked the way the cars handle.  In terms of \"boots on the ground\" game play Marcus is quick on his feet and most of the time super precise.  I do wish the developers would have put more emphasis on the \"parkour\" aspect.  Remember how in the first game if you kept Aiden running and just held down O on ps4, Aiden would automatically jump, slide, or roll through certain obstacles?  Marcus does this also, and it looks really cool the way he flips, and somersaults around, but doesn't really effect the way you tackle missions.  I would have loved to upgrade a skill tree that is more or less based on free-running.  Marcus relies a lot more on hacking than Aiden did which I like a lot.  My only problem is that picking up a gun and shooting people is really at odds with Marcus' character.  I'm sure a lot of players don't really care about all that, and it certainly isn't a big deal, it just feels kind of weird.  Other that that though Watch Dogs 2 is really fun and for the most part improves on everything that was wrong with the first game.

For such a good idea, however, Ubisoft seems to miss what exactly is so great about it. In my opinion what makes the idea of a hacking vigilante appealing is the idea that the player doesn't need guns because the environment is their weapon. Watch Dogs 1 missed the opportunity to do something truly special the moment it decided to include guns, and Watch Dogs 2 is not much better in this regard. The story, on the other hand, is clearly improved from the original. In my opinion, a major positive is the fact that they chose to focus on crafting more lighthearted characters and themes, so they used the cheesy, dialogue to their advantage while crafting the story. The nonlinear missions allow for a more unique approach to the story, yet it negatively effects the pacing, and does not work nearly as well as if they allowed the entire story to be avoidable and blocked the final mission with a skill barrier rather than an arbitrary number of followers. That would have undoubtedly been the optimal way to experience Watch Dogs 2, because every mission in the game is extremely similar to the one before it. Very few use unique mechanics or structure to distinguish themselves, instead they use songs to set a tone. It's an interesting idea because it gives each mission a unique style, but it can't mask how repetitive the format   of the mission is. Most of the missions essentially amount to sneaking around an area, pressing a button, and waiting for a progress bar. As a result, the main story got old extremely quickly, and because there was very little structure to the level progression, nothing feels like it's changed from the beginning of the game to the end. Even the final mission hardly changes the formula. It simply puts the player in a different environment that functions and effects the player in exactly the same way as all other environments. It can be fun to arrest the gang members or order a hit on security guards and sneak past while the mayhem is unfolding, however this can be easily exploited to remove every enemy from the mission. As a result, many missions can be cleared with very little challenge.

The story is refreshing and essentially a compilation of several short tales regarding how each member of the Finch family died (this is not a spoiler btw). Each story is different and told in a separate style from the others. In this sense, the game never feels repetitive yet at the same time, lacks fluidity. The structure of the story is not too smooth, and in this sense, the big picture feels much smaller than it should be.

What the trailer presented and what the game turned out to be were completely different things. I wish I could get a refund of my time and money. I like walking simulators. I like graphic novels with a great story. And therein lies the problem with this game. The visuals are top of the line. Beautiful and realistic graphics. Well designed controls. The sound is without any faults. The story? Not so much. It centers around a teenage girl who comes back to her creepy and mysterious family home after being suddenly forced to leave years ago. She enters the house where all the rooms had been sealed by her mother years ago, and finds her way inside. There she finds journals and documents that explain the family \"curse\" if you can call it that.Everyone, dating back several decades, is dead. And all of them died disturbing and bizarre deaths. Reading the documents transports you into the final moments of each deceased member of her family. The first, a demented little girl who thinks that a sea monster killed her. A teen former child star whose grim and morbid ending plays out in what I can only describe as a scene stolen directly from Tales of the Crypt. Where she's murdered by...Halloween monsters? A giggling monster with a high pitched voice laughs his way through her story, and at the end, jokes about the only thing left of her being her severed ear. A little boy who kills himself by jumping off a swing in a scene that's over in less than 5 minutes. A toddler who kill himself by drowning in the tub in another 5 minute scene. The scenes are all mostly a few minutes in length, and then you crawl through secret passages into the next hidden room with a new morbid story. The problem is not that it's short. It's the story or stories. You finish the game and learn what happened to the protagonist- which is predictable- and you're still several stories short of what happened to several distant family members. But I couldn't care less. The brief several minute long glimpses into each family member's morbid and disturbing deaths feel short, empty, and pointless. Yes, the deaths are tragedies. But many of them aren't even based in reality, and you learn virtually nothing about each character. Except a short bio and then how they died. In the end everything is perfect...except for the story.

Just like 2016's Doom, this game is a fast, fluid, challenging and rewarding shooter. But unlike Doom 2016, this game actually has one of the most engaging stories in an FPS I have personally ever played. The story itself touches on the main protagonist and his allies own humanity and struggle to escape oppression with a series of special operations in a 1960s America over thrown by the 3rd reich. In context the game starts immediately after The New Order, reccuring characters and themes all intact. The game starts you as a broken BJ Blazkowitz, suffering from internal injuries, being hunted by one of the main antagonist of the new order, Frau Engel, a sadistic Nazi general out for Blazkowitz blood after the events of the prior game. Literally being broken, the first half of the game is very stealth heavy, you can go guns blazing if you understand the enemy placements and environments you are in, but since the game starts you with such low health this can become a fairly difficult task. Around the half way point you are given new gadgets and boosted health which makes the game much more viable for your preferred playstyle. Which is a strong point, the game mixes elements of Machine games prior products very well. Visceral melee and stealth is reminiscent of Butcher Bay, while the fast paced duck and weave shooting is much like The Darkness. The gameplay all feels highly refined, aside from a few stealth sections feeling a bit gimmicky and unfair due to enemy placements and the ultra aggressive AI. A lack of multiplayer may come off as a turn off to some, but this does not personally bother me, being someone who prefers a solid single player offering without tacked on multiplayer. The campaign ranges anyshere from 10-15 hours or so depending on skill and difficulty selected, which I find a solid length for a single player shooter, where many last less than 6 hours in this day and age of MP focused triple A shooters. Personally this game, along with 2016's Doom, have been a true joy to play for me. The blend of retro style ultra violent gunplay, and modern tactical shooting mixed with stealth, knock the ball way out of the park. If youre a fan of a good single player experience, but this game and play it several times. If lack of MP disappoints you, at least try renting it or wait for a massive price drop, you may enjoy what you find."], ["Soulstorm83901", "User", "10", "A fantastic sequel in every possible the new colossus improves on the game in every way.

But with the lack of anything to play currently on the PS4, and if you are dying to get into the Doom Beta, it may be worth it if you have some extra cash to spend. The story is very convoluted and flies all over the place. Without a multiplayer segment, the game feels like on content. 12 hour shooter on medium difficulty. The shooting mechanics and guns are very fun and it feels like an old school shooter. The problem comes with the developers using resources to only have a single player game, but it falls short due to jarring cut scenes while in the middle of the action. When it picks up a lot of the time, you enter a cut scene and it's almost a let down. Stealth mechanic is very easy to get into. With that said, full price for a 12 hour single player campaign with lack of multi-player doesn't cut it today.  It is great to be back in the Wolfenstein universe, but they should have added up to date multiplayer that we saw in RTCW to make it worth the valuer of a purchase.

I will now address a few issues (mostly that other people who do not have any understanding or appreciation for the fps genre or who are \"professional critics\" have). 1.) This game is heavily sci-fi and partway through develops an almost Uncharted-like plot but not nearly as ridiculous as Uncharted  1 or 2 and at least as well written, if not better. 2.) The fps element is very nice with different sliding mechanics and a good array of weapons (hooray for weapon wheel) along with upgrades found through miniquests and exploration but almost always on the path towards your goal. The only annoying thing is the occasional \"idk where i have to be\" and when you are set up against heavy enemies without a realization if it is a \"run and use environment\" or \"miniboss\" moment. 3.) The AI is a little off on stealth sometimes but they just as often come running on in from places you forgot about compared to looking over a dead body. Mostly, this just puts them on alert because they can't see you. The downside (and upside) is that only commanders can raise the alarm for additional troops so making a normal trooper suspicious has little consequence. However, stealth is useful but hardly necessary or guaranteed - most of the time, stealth is for removing a few nuisances and commanders before graduating to some classic fps horde/defend/boss fights. And as for the loot system, it quickly becomes manageable (by button spamming) and dual wielding is unwieldy but occasionally necessary. 4.) The graphics behaved fine and only once did I have to restart because in the loading to end a level (and save) my ps4 froze and got caught in an endless loading loop but otherwise I was fine. 5.) The environments are very nice, the perfect mixture of corruption, degredation, futurism, and nazism. Particularly, the first mission did a very nice job of making an interactive tutorial. 6.) (OVERALL) My overall impression, granted I have only played just over half the game i believe (chapter 8 or 9), is that this game is fantastic. It is exactly what it attempts to be: a story-driven, action-packed, player-defined thrillride with moderate replay value and severe doses of Nazi and sci-fi elements. This is a step up from the most recent Wolfenstein games and definitely above the recent fps games that have come out. Basically, this game is just a half-notch under Metro: Last Light in terms of the best fps singleplayer since the Bungie Halo games and may even be as good as the first Bioshock by the time I finish it. (Here is my end rant, mostly just venting about the review which I see in my sidebar now) This game is tried and true fps mixed with a little dishonored and doused in Nazis and sci-fi. It's plain awesome. As for Gamer.nl which says, \"why not something new\", this is new. This is a reboot of a dying but legendary franchise. What is created here is a perfected game. Not one that is overdone and boring, pulling on ridiculous attempted realism/ conspiracies (recent CoDs and BFs) or that attempts to redefine its core values and makes a repetitive, boring, lack of weapon wheel and complete perversion of perfected game mechanics (Bioshock Infinite). This is a pure, fun, story driven fps that I will replay over the summer. It is a game designed to entertain, to enthrall, to bring back the joy of killing Nazis over and over in style, something sorely missed in an age of games attempting to create a plausible future. So buy this game, sit down, and prepare for a game that combines the two greatest possible features in the most perfect way ever achieved.

The game becomes too easy later on, which leads to later dungeons been very boring and the fact that later dungeons are longer, only worsens the experience. There isn't enough content between dungeons were you explore and get more story and because you get all the basic stuff you need from your hub town, all the other towns you visit are mostly pointless, besides receiving the odd dull fetch quests. The familiar towns from past games would be more interesting if they were larger and looked more true to their original designs.

Finally giving long time fans turn-based combat once more, and with a neat new pokemon-like system of collecting and combining monsters or in this case \"mirages\". But World of Final Fantasy's greatest strength lies in its feelings of nostalgia. Chibi style or no i found myself smiling with delight every time i saw i character or creature i've enjoyed in the series make its cute debut in the game. However, for all of its strengths its the downsides that end up becoming more of a factor as you progress further and further into the campaign. Collecting and stacking mirages is quite fun, at first. But with well over a hundred and only being able to change them out at save points or the main hub it gets to be a pain of trying to make sure the ones you rely on are properly leveled and the ones you ones you may need also get added time. You can find yourself suddenly facing an enemy and having to go into your collection for one particular creature you've never used and know need to spend time leveling just it up all so you can unlock one particular ability it has that you need to win. I love strategy, but here you must plan and prepare for anything and that's a little hard to do with such a variety of creatures. This gets even more of a pain when in areas of the game there are puzzle switches which require the right combination of mirages to open or treasure areas you cant reach unless you have a mirage with you that has the ability that area requires you to cross. This means anytime you come to one of this points on each map you must hike it all the way back to the start to access your collection and then go all the way back keeping in mind to still try to keep the ones you need in combat. this isn't too bad at first but with longer more enemy ridden areas later in the game it gets extremely frustrating. As for the areas its \"rinse and repeat\" at its most boring. With 20 chapters in the games main campaign each one begins with discovering a new hallway like area and a classic final fantasy character to go with it. you run down the hallway setup collecting along the way until you reach the random boss at the end then repeat on the next chapter and so on. The story itself is rather bland and if there something more to it its hard to find due the forced corny nonsense jokes the game tries to make literally every dialogue encounter. there is usually one or two lines to push the story along followed by 6 or 8 lines where your main characters take something the other said and somehow force a joke out of it even if it doesn't make a shred of sense. To me, its not the cute aspect that makes this game for children. its the dialogue. not to mention your companion through this game, a cute white fox-like creature named Tama constantly talks to your party but uses the word \"the-\" in random places that comes off less cute and more annoying because it distracts for any substance she might be talking about. Example: instead of saying \"OW! that really hurt me!\" Tama will say \"The-OW! that really hurt the-me!\" See how awkward that is to read? its even harder to hear and focus on the lines and she says it every time she speaks. This game can be a lot of fun at the beginning but i find it becomes more of an annoying bore the more i play it. If you want classic final fantasy this just isn't that unfortunately. Classic characters and turn-based combat are as far as it goes"], ["mikehettfield", "User", "9", "Beautiful game, excelent music, great humor, I love the turn based hybrid system, extensive campaing, random encounters could be a issue for some of the newest audience, but it's a nice game to at least try, someting clean and pure without needing to be childish like ninentdo franchises, nor being as serious like some of the darkests final fantasies, my daughters love it and we share the taste for this meaningful franchise on my life, and i'm happy new generations get to appreciate and share it with us."], ["eledi", "User", "10", "I picked this game up, not expecting too much from it.

Many mechanics are geared towards children and sacrifice complexity and compelling story and game mechanics in an effort to dumb down its own working mechanics to the lowest common denominator. WoFF offers a chibi-style aesthetic that may be a turn off for some; however in all honesty it pairs rather well with the light hearted and comical approach the game takes with atmosphere and dialogue. The story is geared towards children and/or those gamers who really do not want complexity or dark tones in their games. In terms of comedy, the game is rather hit or miss. This is because of the Japanese reliance on exaggeration of movements and tones, a practice that does not always translate to a Western audience. Combat wise, the game is pretty much a Frankenstein attempt at combining Pokemon and Final Fantasy, which is just annoying and get in its own way as the game progresses.

WWE's debut on next-gen just feels empty, lacking that feeling of control that made the past two entries worth picking up. The very first thing you'll notice is the music; instead of being greeted by John Cena's theme on startup, you get a playlist of \"current\" songs from the most random genre pools that never seems different.. You'll consistently hear \"Ready\" by B.o.B followed by \"Workin'\" by Big Smo every other cycle. While I will admit to liking most of the songs, none of them (even the so called WWE Version of \"Wild Ones\" doesn't exactly scream wrestling) feel at home in a WWE game. Beyond the weird mix of rap, rock, country, and dubstep, the main problem with the soundtrack is the absolute lack of variety. No longer do you have over twenty themes to pick from as in 2k14, but a grand total of twelve. You'll hear these songs a lot, because the creation suite takes a godawfully long time to do just about anything. When you're just trying to find a good pair of pants within the small selection you're given, listening to Flo Rida for the fifth time gets aggravating quickly. Speaking of the character creation suite, gone is most of what made it fun. I never used any of the crazier options present in WWE 13 or 2k14, but the variety was nice. Here, every CAW will look the same regardless of tweaking. You can no longer pad out the small Divas roster with created divas, either. This presents a huge problem given the love the community has for content creation. At the very least, you can finally edit Superstar outfits to create, for example, the current look of Dean Ambrose without sacrificing authenticity. Clothing options are just poorly thought out. In addition to the lackluster CAW suite, the MyCAREER mode is nothing special. Sure, you can now start from the bottom and work your way up, unlike putting a created Superstar into Universe, but playing through the first four tutorial matches with Bill DeMott yelling at you is truly an experience. They get points for realism, but you'll hear the same couple lines every time he feels your performance is lacking. In the tutorial match where you essentially have to let your opponent beat the Christ out of you in order to kick out of a pin, you'll hear him telling you how terrible you're doing at least every minute. After that, it's much of the same. The graphics actually are pretty good, if you really need a positive thing to say about this game. Well, that's going a bit far. They're good to a degree. Some wrestlers really do look like they should. Cody Rhodes, Chris Jericho, and Randy Orton are shining examples. Meanwhile, John Cena, Dean Ambrose, and Dolph Ziggler just look off. John Cena and Dean Ambrose are particularly bad, due in part to the popularity they had while the game was in development. John Cena looks like a caveman with his gigantic forehead and cartoon-like facial animations. Dean Ambrose, meanwhile, just looks washed out like he's got a terrible filter over his model. What really matters, though, is the modes. What you really play. How are those? Well, the 29 you're presented with aren't too bad. It sounds like a huge number, doesn't it? It's really not. Everything in One on One is the same as in 6-man aside from the total number of Superstars currently active, so there's really only eleven match types. Not bad, but not the total representation that could have been. You can no longer tweak the matches beyond who participates, what the arena is, and if there's a manager in the match. This makes for some exceptionally boring singles matches, and the total lack of variety really shows. Pacing during a match has been severely hampered by the addition of Chain Wrestling, a series of rock-paper-scissors and quick-time events the AI unfairly cheats at, which combined with the spotty counters and inhuman timing required to pull them off results in odd matches and ridiculous comeback victories. All in all, the game falls far short of the expectations set by 2k14. While the past few entries have been flawed, they succeeded in being fun if nothing else. The most fun I had with 2k15 was actually playing random singles matches to provide material for this review, so if you're creative enough to come up with your own stories and matches, you'll probably have fun for a little while. Universe is still the way to go for that instant WWE fix, but with a roster that's already outdated and almost no way to fix it yourself using CAW to tweak current Superstar looks or new additions to the rosters, it's going to eventually become just as mundane as the rest of the game. To be clear, the game succeeds where it counts for wrestling fans: It's a decent game for those hardcore fans. For the average wrestling fan that prefers the feel of 2k14, it's an offering best skipped."], ["ghost2116", "User", "2", "Let me start with this.

So forget the stamina that's not even the worst part of this, the reaction time or doing moves or finishers sucks the most its to damn slow it doesn't compute most of the time, you have to mostly stump on the guys when you're trying to do ground moves. then all the doppelgangers they put in which is easily avoidable with crating generation mode where you the player can choose what era of the wrestler you wanna be for example instead of having two Hulk Hogan's, two CM Punk's, two Randy Orton's, two Chris Jericho's, two Dave Batista's,two Daniel Bryan's and so on and so on who all do exactly the same move sets of them original selves but are slightly different in their looks or outfits or move sets but that depends on what wrestler like for example the two Daniel Bryan's, one dose the running knee and Yes lock while the other dose the yes lock and Cattle Mutilation double arm bridge submission hold. so you the player chose one Daniel Bryan and the era of him every time you are either in season mode or exhibition match because honesty as I say every year a WWE game comes out who uses the double when playing in season mode or exhibition matches? probably no one dose so its a wast of adding or getting the wrestlers as DLC's also it's clearly a wast of space and laziness on the game makers to add in the full rosters for example Adam Rose or the Ascension, Paige should not be DLC they should have been already include in the game but it shows once again the laziness of the producers be 2K now or be THQ previous. oh yeah the career mode where they start you off with hardly nothing for points to build up your homemade wrestler but there are guys on NXT like Baron Corbin that win their matches in 30 seconds or less by doing one or a few moves without have to get count out victories so that kills the realistic part of 2K15 especially their career mode because you either win by count outs or by wrestling your opponents outside the ring most of the time hoping to get your signature then finishers and hope that's enough to win you your match up if not who ever you are put up against easily beats you and that goes the same with training mode even though its supposed to help you acquire more points as well knowledge to how to play and practice you to better you and your performance witch mostly isn't the case because you get beat by your sparring partners. So this game 2K15 has many faults its the worst wrestling game I have ever played in years the only thing that stands out is the graphics I give this game the five Roman and Caesar thumbs down and it should be fed to the lions if this game was edible that's how bad WWE 2K15 truly is unfortunately"], ["Nectarofgeeks", "User", "5", "So where can we start with this game.

AI can reverse 100% of your moves 100% of the time. But you better know when to press reverse because if you wait til the prompt appears your already too late. You can try to punch the opponent but they can pull off any and all grapple moves they want halfway through your punch. That's another thing the grapple system. WTF! it makes no sense. If you press X its a normal grapple, Left stick and X is medium and Hold X its strong or something like that. From there move the stick and press X or Hold X again to actually pull of a grapple move. Ok except the problem with that is that if you try to do a grapple move early in the match you have to do a game of rock, paper, scissors which 99% of the time leads to you losing your grapple and getting beat out. Also say you do get into a regular grapple you have no idea when to pull off the next grapple move so might as well just tilt the stick and spam the X button hoping your going to actually pull off a grapple move....but no you won't you'll just get reversed and spend the next 10 minutes rolling around on the mat hoping to be able to get up.

The matches can be fun but most of the time they are boring. The A.I is very bad and once you get used to the controls the game will feel as easy as a kids game, even on the hardest difficulty. The roster is definitely a good one for the average WWE fan. There's many superstars from the past and present to choose from. The MyCareer mode is laughably bad and is VERY repetitive to the point where you will sometimes face the same opponent over and over again without any story-lines or cut-scenes happening. Universe Mode is very much the same as the previous installments and the newly implemented promos are horrendous and riddled with countless grammatical errors. In fact most of the promos make little to no since. Here's an example, in some of the promos you will call out another wrestler and when they come out your superstar will insist that they interrupted them. Does that make sense to you? Of course not. The only redeemable part of this game is the creation suite, which is basically the same as WWE 2K16 but has improved a bit. Oh, I forgot one thing, THE BUGS. So many bugs in every single game mode, especially in the matches. Even some bugs that have been in the game for YEARS. In short, WWE 2K17 is basically the same as WWE 2K16 with some minor changes that over all don't really effect your experience.

Como f\u00e3 de wrestling, isso acaba por ser o mais importante."], ["fr33xwilly", "User", "8", "Graphics were overhauled to look incredibly real this year. Gameplay is more or less the same with the new carry system and other features. MyCareer is 100% better than last year but gets repetitive real fast. Universe Mode hasn't changed at all regardless of what they've said and that's a let down. Creation Suite was improved fixing bugs from the year before and Community Creations seems to have been fixed as well (still it is pre-order customers only right now). The A.I have been given an improvement it seems as they are tough to beat on Legend. However, the reversal window is completely broken making some matches just the AI beating you until the end. The icon will pop up and you still won't hit it in time. Overall solid game, wish they'd fix the reversals however"], ["Drkside", "User", "9", "The visual upgrade is impressive, Mammoth roster of stars from various eras, Exhaustive creation suite, Road to Glory adds a purposeful spin to competitive multiplayer.  BEST WWE 2K ever!  Some much to enjoy and love.  WOW!"], ["Jhed291", "User", "10", "Firstly I like wrestling games, and second, a bunch of new and returning modes are here in this game, and third I won't say its the best, but I can guarantee on the aspects within everything and I mean everything since I played WWE SvR 2011 on my PSP, and because of this, I'm giving it 10/10, despite that I won't say its the best, but electrifying great."], ["007700", "User", "10", "WWE 2K18 is a game which I have only imagined to be playable in my dreams. Thankfully, for the first ever 2K Games & Yukes has fulfilled every single WWE fan's dream with WWE 2K18. It's a game which I have always wanted to exist. And finally, it exists in 2017. It's a WWE game that 2K should have built from the start of this new generation of consoles, because PS4 & Xbox One has enough power for these kind of experiences in a professional wrestling video game. WWE 2K18 stays true to the WWE formula. Infact, 2K wasn't lying at all. WWE 2K18 is really the most realistic WWE video-game I've ever played. It features a brand new graphics engine, thousands of new animations, and for the first time in years, really really good commentary. All of this makes WWE 2K18 as close to the real WWE broadcast as possible. The gameplay is ultra realistic, the entrances are realistic, the superstars & divas, the lighting, the arenas, the crowd, all of these are presented with massive attention to detail. Everything that is possible in WWE TV broadcast today is possible in this game. myCAREER is back with a bang and this time myCAREER is really worth playing due to the added ability of free-roaming in backstage which was also featured in SmackDown vs Raw 2011. myPLAYER is also a brand new mode which consists of both myCAREER and ROAD TO GLORY. Road to Glory mode is the best addition to any WWE game till date. The creation suite is truly epic. While making a superstar, players are given the ability to choose from 8 different fighting styles. All of the features that were absent from the previous iterations returns in WWE 2K18. The gameplay is the best in the series to date and it's very very realistic. Every superstar has got his/her own animations to make them react like themselves, like they do on WWE events. Overall, to sum up my review, WWE 2K18 is a complete WWE product, fully loaded and ready to run. I want to thank 2K Games & Yukes from the bottom of my heart for making a game like WWE 2K18. BE LIKE NO ONE.."], ["silverMUFFIN", "User", "7", "While this game is no doubt better than 2k17 unfortunately mycareer is broken. I've attempted to complete MITB about 6 or 7 times now and cannot progress past that point. In addition, mycareer features a myriad of other annoying bugs from backstage wrestlers spasming to randomly pairing you with another wrestler as a tag team (cancelling out the tag team you're currently in), plus the people you talk to backstage are constantly saying the wrong names (for example when I ran out and attacked Sami Zayn before his match somebody backstage asked me why I  attacked Mojo Rawley). Universe mode also is experiencing issues as you cannot cut a promo that you schedule into the show among other things. Those are the only 2 modes I have played so far so I'm sure their are bugs in the other modes I just have not noticed. Overall, I feel like this game could have been really good (and still can be) if they had waited another month or two and fixed all the bugs and then released it. Here's to hoping 2k releases a patch soon."], ["TJP92", "User", "8", "WWE 2k18 is another step in the right direction for the franchise. With a complete overhaul in the graphics department, the game brings character models to life more so than most games have this generation. The game-play has not changed much but the player is exposed to fantastic story telling in the way the character portray the pain and exhaustion they're experiencing throughout a match. The creation suite has expanded itself to bring more depth to your character looks, arenas, move-sets has more detail than ever before and you will spend hours just messing around with the many possibilities it provides. The create a match feature is back, however it seems extremely basic compared to what others might have hoped for. Not being able to create a falls count anywhere Hell in a Cell match is a example of the potential the game failed to deliver in this regard. Universe Mode is still needing of work to be done. The addition of the power ranking system is great, but it fails to be something special due to how messy it can be. Over 200+ superstars are on the rankings ever if they aren't featured on a show. The promo system has a lack of innovation as it returns with nothing new except for dialogue. It's potential has yet to even be toyed with it seems this year. The Road to Glory/ My Career mode is interesting at best, however with the limited options for character customization at the beginning of the mode, it won't be as fun until later on in the story when you finally have what you want for your character. The problem with this is simply, it's all in loot boxes. Overall WWE 2k18 is easily the best 2k has done with the series and is a great sign of things to come in 2k19."], ["Strong_Style101", "User", "8", "While it is not the perfect wrestling game, as the menus look horrible, and the graphics are not the STEP up that I was expecting, they are still somewhat realistic.

It's not just one or two small glitches, entire matches - the Royal Rumble, elimination matches, so many things are unplayable because the matches never finish. Something happens and the wrestlers can't get up, or can't react, or don't go for a pin etc. etc. and match just never finishes. Backstage matches even worse, everything is total glitch. I'm sorry but I really, really, really don't understand how they can possibly release a game that is so full to the brim with glitches and charge people 80 euros for it. It's really beyond unacceptable. Did anyone even test this game? Unbelievable really."], ["BigMatchu", "User", "10", "I'm a huge wrestling fan and played every single wrestling game from the smack down series on ps1 all the way to Wwe2k18.

Yes there are glitches but it's fairly new and there will be patches and updates"], ["MasterPhantom", "User", "0", "How is it that we let these people make and sell us the same crappy game year after year.

Great option if you want a fight game."], ["beatingstuff88", "User", "7", "I love the new graphics engine, create a wrestler options and better fluidity in the game."], ["TheManWhoBools", "User", "5", "Dis WWE game is okay. i give it 5 out of 10 bcoz u can't play as  Indian Wrestling God Great Khali, however u can play as The Big Dog Roman Rains and Wrestling mastert Jon Cena.

MyCareer does not give us control, the story is a rail and you would think they put money into paying wwe stars for voice overs but nope, only voiced are the old recycled commentary from 4 years ago. Not worth a dime! Nothing like your opponent getting stuck in a wall or table. To call it broken would be ten steps ahead of what this is. Last 2K game I will ever buy."]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "Switch", "Xbox One"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/19ee048e6776444875e3af34621f2484.jpg"}
