Assume the role of a second-year high school student who becomes a Persona-user through an unexpected incident. Having moved to Tokyo just before the start of the school year, he finds residence at a cafe run by his parents' friend, and is about to get his first taste of school life in the big city. The protagonist seems quiet and well-mannered at first glance, but gives a completely different impression once he has donned his \"phantom thief\" guise. What is the motivation of his alter ego...? Arsene is the protagonist's initial Persona, characterized by a mask-like face and a pair of huge, black wings. Some suspect an association between its name and the famous gentleman-thief, Arsene Lupin. What is the origin of this Persona, and what power does it hold? This is an account of the wild adventures experienced by a team of young misfits, who grow dramatically along the way. While attending Shujin High School, the protagonist will encounter a number of individuals, each with his or her own distinctive personality and charm. School life in the city is full of surprises and interesting events! It will most definitely be a fun year for the protagonist, living as an ordinary student.

The style of the game is great and it has some of the best ui/menu design I've ever seen in a game (at least in recent memory.) The game also has a great storyline with tons of clever twists and unexpected turns. When I say this though keep in mind that I am mainly speaking about the plot itself because some of the characters (mainly the males) are just not that likeable, have some questionable lines, and one of them in particular is downright weird as a a character. That said that is about the only major complaint I have with game. The combat is fast, fluid, and flashy. It has so much style and it truly does capture that feeling of making you and your team feel like badasses. There is so much complexity withing comboing moves with different personas and there is even 4 different ways you can handle an enemies fate if you can stun all enemies on the field are once. I truly do believe all other turn-based/party-based games should take note from this. The dungeon design is some of the best I've ever seen in games period and it complements the combat greatly. They give you a feeling of truly wanting to explore these elaborate labyrinths the developers created. As if this wasn't all enough to sell as a game as is Persona 5 also has the whole other end of the gameplay spectrum where you live the everyday life of a Japanese high school student. You can work jobs, recreational activities with friends, shop places, study for school, and befriend/romance other characters within the game. This all on paper sounds incredibly boring but in practice it is the glue that hold Persona 5 as a complete package together. It's done with just enough a gameplay segment to feel like you did something but is gone and you are transitioning into another activity within moments. This all gives you experience in various stats that open gameplay options and make you stronger in the dungeon-traversal aspect of the game. It should be commended especially that there is so many different rotating parts and systems within the game that all interlock and complement each other perfectly. In the graphics department you are covered as well as this game comes with one of the best art styles I've seen in recent years and shows even with less photo-realism you can still create something beautiful to look at. This game really captures the feeling of playing an interactive manga/anime tv show with over 100 hours of content to delve into. This game came really close to a 10 for me but unfortunately about half the characters not being very interesting or likeable in a game that is about 50% cutscenes/text held it back from that kind of game for me. I also had very minor issues with the fact that some areas lock you into a fixed camera angle which can make interacting with objects kind of irrating (although it looks great during the platforming sections within the dungeons.) Overall though this is a must buy no-matter what if you are a true fan of story-based rpg's even with it's few niggling flaws nothing can hold it back from the things that it sets out to do it does all damn-near perfectly for the most part.

A very common Japanese story background, very similar to many others Japanese TV programs and movies. The main character was being framed for something that he has never committed. Unfairness and injustice have affected his life. But he had never given up and tried his best to overcome many failures and fight for fairnesses, fight for justice. Nevertheless, the best part of the game is scripting the characters. All characters are well scripted and have imaginative designed personalities. When you chat or hang out with them in the game, you do feel like you are interacting with the real person.  Both memorable and stands out, something that was missing from the new Mass Effect game. Gameplay is excellent. You spend roughly half the time \"fighting\" shadows and the other half hanging around Tokyo. The fightings are great, the upgrade system, the confidants and personas were well reflected on most interesting parts of JRPG, millions of selections of magics, guns and physical attacks. No doubt JPRG fans would love the fighting system! It is also fun to hang around in Tokyo and participating in different activities, however, I hope there are more things to do and perhaps add in a few more areas. This is because I have maxed out of all confidence and done everything in the world map when there are still 20 days left. Sound effects are great! Great voice covers and great tracks!

This compilation of both games with a massive visual revamp is fantastic, especially if you get it for free with Playstation Plus. You pilot a ship whose goal is to rescue survivors, gather gems and survive varies environmental hazards, destroying enemies along the way. What makes the game so fun is the excellent visuals, the tight controls and the combination of environment elements like lava, water, gas and oil coupled with special \"suits\" your ship can acquire which give you the ability to shoot some of these elements or manipulate them in other ways. Realistic fluid/gas physics are applied, meaning you can rapid-fire rockets into a body of water and see it splosh around believably.  Need to get through a pool of lava without burning your ship up? Try shooting through rock underneath a pool of water to release it, creating rock when it hits the lava, then blast your way through that rock.  Need to destroy a crowd of enemies quickly? Use your missiles to propel lava onto a cloud of gas surrounding them then watch the resulting inferno. Put on your ice suit to shoot cold rays that freeze water, or your magnetic suit to repel oil (ok so that one's a little whacky, but it works in the game! We'll pretend it's \"iron oil\"). The game is fun when played alone but even more fun played co-op. Local co-op is supported for the entire single player campaign - which is huge by the way; 150 levels in total. Secret areas are in abundance, and to find gems you'll have to be cunning in your exploration of the environment. A gem might be hidden beneath a pool of lava, so solidify it to rock with your water or ice suit then blast to the bottom to get the gem. A new multiplayer mode has been added which is very entertaining too; it's 1v1 with the defensive player trying to rescue survivors and take them back to their \"safe zone\", while the offensive player attempts to take them down. A ton of fun power-ups can be earned through XP, these include abilities like shooting homing rockets, reversing the other player's controls and more.

The problem with this is actually that it transforms what could be a quality game to add to your collection to play forever, into a glorified rental that, given the reputation of the publisher, will only be playable for 2-3 years before it becomes nothing but fond memories. Publishers are counting on this, because in theory if you are unable to play the old game, you have more incentive to buy the new one. They also do this to ensure that no tampering can be done with the premium game's free-to-play currency system, which is an insult to gamers that remember the days when those \"services\" were obtainable not through real world money, but through cheat codes, which were free to everyone.

It is borrowing the story telling styles of Half Life and Bioshock and Portal, and although on the whole I can at least objectively say there is an effort to be more creative and clever in the story department than we've seen in the Dishonored series, it suffers personally to me because the narrative style is an unpleasant mash of Arkane's story telling trying to act like someone else, and I'm not fond of Arkane's story telling.  On PS4 the graphics are weak.  There is no sense of dynamic lighting, the background textures are almost polygonal, and the character design is too derivative of Dishonored, and the look of 19th century whale punk cartoonishness doesn't quite fit the narrative, and is a piece of what's driving me away from the narrative.  The game play just isn't sufficient to overcome that, because it's floaty and simple and really just relies on simple surprise tactics you overcome simply by assuming every inanimate object is a Dark Souls Mimic chest, and that gets tiring.

The game does an amazing job of making you feel like you are on the space station Talos 1. Immersion is this games biggest strength. Audio clips, emails, files, and dead bodies are scattered all over the station giving you a look into the past before things were, or as things were going to **** You really get a sense of seeing what happened to these people. What the aliens did to them. Its wonderful stuff. The graphics also help with the immersion factor. It's not jaw-dropping gorgeous by any means, but the design aesthetic is done really well. Also constantly seeing the moon or earth out of the many huge windows really keeps reminding you that you are in space. Combat is good in this game. Not great mind you. The weapons are all very neat and somewhat original, but using them is the problem. It never seems to really become natural. The shooting mechanics are clunky. You'll find yourself missing shots you shouldn't have missed. Ammo is also very scarce in this game. You can recycle junk you find to craft more, but later on in the game when enemies become more abundant, you will constantly hear the clicking sound of a gun with no bullets as you hopelessly swing your trusty old wrench around. And let me tell you about this wrench. You will use this thing for the entire game. Its the only thing that will keep you alive in tough times. But using it is much worse than the guns. You just swing it around hoping to hit your target. The small aliens, called mimics, are always on the ground crawling about, forcing you to try to smash them. You'll find yourself just mashing the trigger button, spinning in a circle trying to kill these guys. This isn't really fun. Not because of the difficulty, its not actually that hard. Its just not fun. Plain and simple. Later in in the game these machine-drone things called operators will start to appear. They are **** They kill you quicker than you can throw your controller at your tv out of frustration. And you are always low on ammo, as previously mentioned, so you really have to just sprint from room to room avoiding them at all costs. Oh and they respawn indefinitely, so killing them is utterly pointless even if you have ammo to spare. This is Preys biggest misstep in my opinion. The game is best when you are creeping around, killing 1 or 2 enemies at a time. Having to sprint to the next objective or get insta-killed really breaks the immersion I just praised earlier. The load times are atrocious. It sometimes takes up to 1 minute to reload after you die, or walk into the next area. This really becomes a problem when you are not quite sure where to go. The game has several different areas. Different parts of the station. Loading between these parts takes forever. And you don't know where to go sometimes, so you could walk into the next area *queue the 1 minute loading screen* realize you are not supposed to be there, and then turn around and leave *queue another 1 minute loading screen* The game loads soo slow I probably spent 10% of my entire play-through staring at the loading screen. I won't really talk about the main story but I will just say that its ok. Nothing special. Its not going to stick with you after you finish the game.

The soundtrack is excellent and I feel compliments the game very well, as its sort of futuristic synth score is sounding like its new-age. My only criticism of the score is that at times it can be a little too strong, and this can ruin some scares that can occur in the game, as the player will be able to see it coming once the tempo of the music increases. With that said, this game is really played best with headphones, as the crack of your footsteps as some of the metal, the scuttle of the mimics as they move around and the change in the tempo of the music can really create a good sense of unease which is why I would HIGHLY recommend playing this game with headphones."], ["Thejano92", "User", "9", "This game is a definitive improvement and re-envision  of a long dead franchise.

The gameplay, however, reveals itself to be punishing and unaccommodating.  Early in the game I had to switch to \"easy\" which did not make the game very easy at all - you are stuck with just your wrench, a pitiful stamina pool and the game pits you against an enemy that can teleport about and has an absolutely tiny hit box.  The early hours of the game are a mind numbing struggle as you are underpowered, slow moving and restricted in your number of approaches.  Furthermore, the game throws you into a huge map with no indication of area difficulty and could see you wander into an area with very challenging enemies completely unprepared.  As you collect weapons, resources and powers (basically, plasmids) you level the playing field a bit.  But right around 2/3 of the way through the game, when you finally feel powerful and prepared to fight, the game just goes wide and starts putting unrealistic numbers of powerful enemies everywhere and hiding behind that \"sometimes it's smarter to sneak or run from the enemies\" story.  Additionally, the side quests are not motivating.  You essentially get nothing for completing them, and since they're basically just a long series of fetch or kill quests you end up having to backtrack a ton.  This process is hampered by long loading screens and tiny areas that you can quickly traverse only to reach your next loading screen.  Ultimately the game makes use of some extremely arbitrary and predictable tropes to extend the gameplay - you found that keycard you needed?

Speaking of updates, the squads feature the roster of the 2014-15 season, something which is shameful ( Cech is still on the Chelsea team, Falcao at Man. U, ect). One can expect many unlicensed teams, but to not even have strips that are the same colour as the real teams is appalling. There are even fewer desirable teams than other versions of PES, with the exclusion of Bundesliga (except for 3 teams), particular Borrusia Dortmund being the most notable. Certain leagues are present (unlicensed may I add) that would not interest the average player, such as the Chilean league and the Championship. The game is also lacking many playable features, something which Fifa is not lacking. However, the actual gameplay and matches feel more engrossing and intense than Fifa but even that is stress inducing. It is way too easy to score and concede and sometimes feels like an arcade, scoring straight from kick off via a through ball is not uncommon. Goalkeepers are atrocious, they parry almost any ball into the box and any hard shot which is on target normally result in a goal. This was also present in the last iteration of PES I have played, 2008. The AI also seems to be lacking, as defenders fail to pick up runs and attackers are slow to react when in offiside positions. The only major positive in the whole game was the training modes, both skills and free training are enjoyable and improve your overall game.

The graphics is superb, playing in 4K looks stunning with wonderful replays that will make you wondering if you are looking to a game or to a real match.

This title should never have been released on a games console. Games are designed to entertain this so called game will leave any new user baffled as to how it works, there is no explanation in the control settings menu as to how any of the sliders effect control its just blank. It\u2019s as though you are required to know how every detail of a car works before you play. Driving in a straight line using the default controls is a technical impossibility. Attempt to turn right then left for example at an apex and the weight shifts so violently the car will instantly slide in the opposite direction. Fans will say the controls must be tweaked to suit your playing style. As a new user I don\u2019t have one yet and the lack of assistance or any sort of guidance as to what to tweak and how my tweaks effect gameplay is frustrating. As there is no in game modification of controls I must suffer through constant loading screens to tweak controls then more loading screens to see the effect. After attempting to play the game for the past week and trawling through forums for a user friendly control setup I have yet to complete a race. In terms of graphics, benchmark it against the much cheaper driveclub and you will see just how bad a pc to console port can be when compared to a console build. The damage is technically ok and trust me you will experience this first hand on your first corner however it\u2019s a generation behind. The cracks in the windows look like they have been created in ms paint. The textures are straight out of playstation 2 development kit guide. The physics may be sim but it certainly doesn\u2019t look or feel like how you would expect a car to act, unless you\u2019re playing with some sort of steering rig the physics do not respond controller gestures as you would expect. For example you would expect a RWD BMW\u2019s wheels to spin smoothly when throttled aggressively with no traction control or anti spin assists instead they jitter and catch grip un expectedly. When I\u2019m in a 500+hp BMW I expect the engine to overpower the tire treads not to somehow catch grip of something and be launched forward for one frame and loose grip in the next. A sign something is very wrong with the physics is when doing doughnut\u2019s in a RWD car you would expect the back end to spin around out wildly and outpace the front, yet somehow this sim offers a very controlled almost locked in turning circle with the rear wheels spinning but as if on tracks. Some may say it\u2019s not sim to do doughnut\u2019s on a track which is fine but as a sim I fully expected the physics would allow it yet they don\u2019t making the physics very unrealistic for a claimed simulator.

The frame rate is not all the time solid but for most of the time it runs perfectly even when a lot of events are going around at the same time.

The combat is pretty enjoyable sometimes it comes down to a good strategy other times you can tear up your enemies forces without losing half your health bar. The ability to run up buildings, pick up people and throw them far distances or any of the deadly bioweapons and powers the Prototype has in his arsenal is sure a blast to experiment with.  The game is an action packed game mixed with horror and science. You will be fighting everything from the military to zombies to other mutants in this extremely violent open world. I don't mind the violence but younger players should stay away limb dismemberment, blood and gore are all to common sites in the world of Prototype the story is strange and sometimes predictable but the characters themselves do have some sort of personality even if it is only vaguely implied. The voice actors did an excellent job and the soundtrack is alright but could be better. A feature to see every ped you killed or every vehicle you stole in the statistics menu is also an awesome touch.

Me being a fan of anime like Parasyte and Tokyo Ghoul I found it awesome how some of the characters abilities in this game is similar to the weapons and powers of anime characters. I bought it recently for a good price and the game is a blast to play if you like out-of-this-world power and carnage then this game is for you! I want the game to do better in sales as unfortunately the chances of another Prototype game is dangerously low."]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/8cdd2938609fb3ac793f504a7c8050ef.jpg"}
