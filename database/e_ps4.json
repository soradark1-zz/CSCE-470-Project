Every negative aspect of UFC Undisputed series and EA MMA title comes into play in this game. It's really the mixture of the negative things that previous experiencec in MMA games brought. EA Sports UFC on PS4 looks almost exactly like Fight Night Champion (2011) on X360 and PS3. And it feels a lot worse. The wooden so-called \"physics\" of UFC Undisputed that made fighters act like puppets is present, too. It looks like the engine doesn't model the speed, the power and weight of strikes real-time, it looks like it's just scripted insted. Heavyweights can eat 5 head-kicks in a row, you can hit your opponent with some brutal knees to the head 8-10 times in a row before he gets knocked out (and they defend quite poorly), and the all eat it like peanuts. Fighters also share the same move set, and Jon Jones performs, say, moves of Anthony Pettis, Alexander Gustafsson - moves of Jon Jones or (!!!) Bruce Lee etc. And the fighting styles has no meaning here anymore, like it would have in EA MMA. There's simply no difference. There is no point in the star roster of the UFC, they all act the same, no authenticity. It's like you play a custom created fighter wrapped in textures of Anderson Silva or any other fighter's appearance. People who enjoyed EA MMA waited for even better game but this time with the UFC roster. But EA Sports UFC is not, by any means, better than EA MMA. It hardly excels even the UFC Undisputed series. The career mode is also boring and repetitive, there is now training camps like those in EA MMA to make at least some differenct. It's like you perform the same sequence again and again, you don't have to do anything else than pressing X to continue and do the same boring drills. And you don't get to choose anything. Another major flaw of this game is the ground game. It's obviously underdeveloped and placed in the game only to check-out the check box in the list. Insanely frequent transition, one button to get up and set yourself free from the guard or clinch, no significant impact from the ground stiking, and the submission system is awful, simply awful. It's too easy for the defending player, and too dumb for the attacking one. You just have to lay there and wait for a flick of left stick to improve your position and tighten the submission. And if you'd play with the skilled players, the ground game loses its meaning completely, just like in EA MMA, when the player with the brilliant timing controlled you completely and you had no chance to get back up. In EA UFC the timing is unforgiving, so the situation is even worse. The only reason to buy this game there is to buy it for playing with friends mano-a-mano, and the friends who know what to do, not button-mashing all the way through. Except for that \"here and there on the evenings\" experience, the game has literally nothing to offer. It's just the arcade project that EA decided to make some quick buck with, riding the MMA and particularly UFC popularity. It just doesn't live up to any promises or expectations, and even besides that, it's dull, boring, and has nothing to do with the 2014 level of technical performance."], ["Clickypool", "User", "9", "great game.

This is because like in Madden each fighter has certain abilities that carry them through fights. For instance BJ Penn is better on the ground than Frankie Edgar but Edgar is better Standing and Defending which plays out to the interest and versatility of the fights. Yu really have to find a character that suits your style, You can't step into the octagn with Daniel Cormier and try to submit Chael Sonnen.

Graphics are beautiful, the controls (lots of people have complained about) are not that difficult to master if you are comfortable with a gaming controller, and the overall presentation makes it feel like I'm watching a PPV.

EA does a good job of making you feel like you are entering the ultimate fighter TV series. Depending on what difficulty you choose to play on the experience differs, and the computers seem to get an advantage in blocking and overall game play. There is also a huge difference between hard difficulty and pro difficulty, but both are rewarding. Now the reason this game does so poorly, the online portion. The system setup is nice every day or so there is a tournament going on, where you have to win fights to advance through the belts to participate in the tiers of the tournament. The issue most are experiencing with the game are the broken mechanics. Moves such as the Muay Thai clinch are a favorite for those who I would assume fail at the game otherwise. Basically a person gets you in a Muay Thai clinch and repeatedly puts knees to the head, While the game is slow to respond and this can result in a knockout after a few knees. You can block and transition, although the player in control of the clinch can cling you around, to throw you off balance and start the grueling task of kneeing you in the face over and over again. The second let down online which is a new trend is preforming a take down, getting up, rinse repeat. The purpose of this action is to waste 5 minutes of game play just to win by decision. Once again you can defend against this action, although you would be spending 15 minutes doing so. When people play the game correctly with some dignity it is a blast using all forms of MMA and actually pitting skill against skill. Although the 1 in 10 chance you get someone who actually wants to play the game, the way the developers intended or the way it is fought in real life, is rare and does not make up for constant exploiting. Overall the idea of the game is good the single player is amazing, if you are buying this game and would like to play online, to pit your skills against others prepare to be let down.

For some reason doin the same stick rotation in certain positions does not always do the same transition. Sometimes my fighter get stuck mid transition as if the animation is frozen and I have to rotate the stick again to finish the transition where it left off. The blocking mechanic is also a problem due to the game having one block button to guard high and low while using other face buttons for heavy high/low blocks. This isn't much of a problem while striking but it absolutely breaks the cage clinch system.

The learning curve is horrendous, I found myself taking notes in able to remember how to do certain moves.  The Dual Shock 4 takes a bit of a beating, not from rage quitting or throwing it around but because of the control system itself. Instead of a fluid quarter circle motion, you find your self furiously rolling the thumbstick in 360 rotations.  The \"Flick\" type movements when on defence work, maybe, 40% of the time, countering is painfully difficult and is purely a fluke when you pull it off.  They've simplified submissions in all aspects, to the point that now they're too easy and they seem to always be a kimura.

Not to mention online players spamming the **** outta the same moves over and over and over again although you are pressing the correct buttons to deny or counter that said move. I honestly do not know why they threw out the old ground and clinch game instead of just adding a few tweaks. I find myself just giving up when playing online because its 99% frustrating and 1% tolerable. The graphics however look amazing thats about the only positive I can take from this. The new ultimate team is flawed beyond sanity simply due to the fact they have made packs available to purchase with real money which in turn makes the online divisions completely unfair. Rich kids with daddies credit card can get Mcgregor's move list with ease. Where as normal people who would rather spend their hard earned money on REAL things are left getting their asses whooped! Such a shame that EA got hold of the UFC license because inevitably they have drained the soul from MMA games. Genuine fans of the franchise are probably going to be disappointed with the game on so many levels but the main one is EA's attempt at creating a sim like game has fallen short and its a confusing mix between arcade stand and slug it out until the game randomly decides who will get rocked first. Even then it sometimes take 5 or 6 instances of an opponent being rocked until you can finish the fight. Blocking is stupid simply because during unlocked states it works fairly realistically but as soon as you or an opponent is stunned (rocked) all you gotta do is hold block and your fists are a forcefield that can withstand literally anything thrown at them. Extremely disappointed with the game and unfortunately I will be steering clear of any future developments by EA and The UFC.

A precious, limited resource that arrived with the meteor, Elex can power machines, open the door to magic, or re-sculpt life into new, different forms.

Being weak and penniless in this game at the start can be felt for many hours, as you cannot just guns blaze in to situations in you power armor after the short tutorial like other games out there. Be ready to learn how to ovoid, outrun, and trick opponents for a good portion of the time, as you will die trying to see how to overcome puzzles. This is not kill small creatures focused leveling game like most RPGs, actually trying to level by killing things in the early game would be slow to futile. Like any game learn how the leveling system works, luckily in this game there are not truly bad choices for the early game, as sneaking and running around for task is the name of the game and few skills will help you in the early game.

But I've played it for about 23 hours now, and while there was a lot of fun in the first 20 hours, it's already gotten old.  That's a very short period of time nowadays for a multi-player game.  Some reviews complained about the grind to open all the monsters and characters at the start, but that was actually the fun part.  That's what kept me playing, hoping to find out that the next character was awesome.  But, once I'd opened them and knew which monster I enjoyed the most, and which hunters I liked the best, the game got boring fast.  I thought it would have longer legs because it is very different playing as a monster than it is playing as a hunter, and each monster and each hunter take different strategy.  But the biggest problems are that the maps don't deliver varied enough experiences and the extra game modes aren't that great.  Also, compared to Left 4 Dead, which I've sunk unlimited hours into and is still a blast to play today, the 4 v. 1 format doesn't lead to good rivalries, because your teams aren't flipping sides and changing roles.  All in all, to keep it interesting, it needs more game types, more varied maps, more monsters, and more hunters.

Not once did I encounter any chugging.  I loved the characters for their sense of humor.  I found myself laughing a lot at the playful banter that happens before each match starts and during.  One of the things I didn't like was the extremely boring sequences in-between fighting.  To me, a lot of each match consisted of run, fight a little bit, run, fight a little bit, etc.  The running part usually lasted a lot longer than each fight sequence.  Another problem I ran into was not so much the game's fault, but my team mates.  I highly suggest you and your close online friends play together and keep it at that, because the whole \"lone ranger\" thing happens to still be ingrained in most multi-player gamers.  There were several instances when me and 2 other team mates were tracking the monster and the medic would run off the opposite direction.  This is especially stupid because there is ABSOLUTELY no chance the medic alone could take down the monster.  They are there to heal players and create weak points on the monster so that the assault class can do more damage.  The trapper traps and the support class acts as the team's \"buffer\".  That is, what I think, makes this game as good or as bad as it is.

Even though there are only 3 characters in every class, everyone plays extremely different especially depending on the rest of team. Add in HUGE maps with living environments filled with man eating plants and packs of savage alien wolves and you get an experience like no other. People can whine all they want to about DLC and unfortunately we live in a world driven by the dollar, but I defend the fact that Evolve is sold for $60. By no means should it be free to play, especially when you consider the team of developers that put in an insane amount of their time to produce such a fantastic polished product.

Some of the mazes are wonderful to experience and the way the moving pieces just always work together at the right time is very satisfying.  I enjoyed my time with it even if it was short lived.  It's hard to peg a genre to Expand or even to be totally convinced that it isn't some kind of art installation, but whatever it is doing, it does it well."], ["Push Square", "Critic", "70", "Expand is a great puzzle game. Navigating your square through monochromatic mazes offers a wonderfully relaxing experience that somehow manages to be calming and wrought with tension throughout. While it\u2019s a relatively short title, its low price point and high fun factor make it a worthwhile venture. Sure, it may not have been a runaway success on its initial release, but we can only hope this title finds its audience this time around."]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/41f50e31f45f4f1e28b8e4c9932fedef.jpg"}
