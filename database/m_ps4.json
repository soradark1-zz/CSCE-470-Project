And any one crapping on the car heavy steering controls is a winey baby, you get bad ass upgrades for your car over time so its no surprise to me that it looks and feels like a hollowed out rust bucket at first. I will mention that my very first death race I finished 1st on the second try no problem, I actually thought it was a little too easy. Once you begin to upgrade you opus(Mad Max's hotrod) car battles become extremely enjoyable and as long as your out on the road you'll have plenty of encounters with roaming bands of enemy vehicles, all of which have different ways of attacking you, as well as different strengths and weaknesses. The real addictive part in this game is collecting scrap, earning upgrades for your car as well as your character and all the awesome ways you can dispatch enemies. The game environment is nothing short of epic, the game action is tons of fun, and the characters you meet are unique and interesting; I never get tired of hearing what the people in the game have to say. Truth be told I'm not a fan of cinematic cut scenes or too much dialogue in a game but in this game it was a pleasure to sit back and watch and listen to the interactions you have with all the characters you run into through out the game. If you like exploring open worlds with endless task and side missions(think borderlands or gta) this game is for you. And I crap on anyones opinion that this game starts to grind, personally I never tire of the gruesome ways you can kill enemies in this game both in hand combat and while driving your vehicle. I mean someone could say that GTA5 starts to grind because it's massive and has repetitive objectives as well, so what ever. People gonna hate thats all I can say.

But after 10 or so hours it begins to be awfully repetitive, to the point that when I stopped playing after a few evenings, I didn't even notice, or miss it.

This game is highly engaging, really interesting as far as expanding the Mad Max world. The story has me by the balls with whether Max is a messiah or not as he liberates the wastelands from tyrannical rule. I love the thought gone into most caves and enemy locations as things can be really interesting to navigate and discover all the hidden loot in a place. I find the set up of the world and missions to be very similar to Infamous Second Son which turns the repetitive open world gameplay into a very interesting game as you can do everything at your own pace, and all effort you put into unlocking the entire world pays off as your home base gets built up more and more. I really like Mad Max as a franchise to begin so I am captivated all the time by this game. I like the aspects of having to refuel or rehydrate (even though I rarely need to fill my car's gas) as it puts you in the moment at all times and immerses you into the game constantly. This also touches on the low ammo in the world and using your resources wisely (harpoon can be a great option that doesn't run out of ammo but you must be in a car to use it).

After watching Mad Max: Fury Road, it made me hyped to buy the game. It exceeded expectations and after playing it for a week straight, ive only progressed 50% through this massive game. Driving through an open wasteland might sound boring, but theres a ton of things to do such as pulling down scarecrows, infiltrating camps, finding scrap and history relics in at least 100 scavenging locations and reading bios about every character, enemy, and location. The customization in this game isn't infinite, but its very good and uprading Max's jacket,  shotgun, wrist armor, and more is very rewarding and enjoyable, and purchasing skills to upgrade Max's fighting skills makes the brutal melee combat even better. The Magnum Opus car is very fun and exciting to upgrade, such as weaponry, rims, armor, engines and more. The graphics are truly next-gen as different rocks and boulders break and fly aroound as you crash into them. The wasteland is truly dynamic and doesn't feel blank or bare in any way. The story wasnt the best but it was pretty good and resembles the Mad Max universe very well. It is one of the only games i ever played that had an enjoyable ending and unlocking special items to use after you have completed the story. There are also different Strongholds where Max can return and add vehicles to his garage, do Wasteland missions for the Stronghold leader, and upgrading the Stronghold is very rewarding. Finding Project Parts and building Oil Pumps to refill Max's vehicles, Maggot farms, Survey crews, and much more. Each Stronghold can upgrade as in donating scrap, and building projects will change the stronghold, such as adding new houses and decorations and more people, making it look way better than what it started with. Max can't do parkour, but he can climb ladders, certain ledges, shimmy trough small gaps, and jump a few inches in the air. This game has THE best camera editor ever. You can take screenshots and add a ton of filters, overlay, logos, blur intensity, exposure, and more to create an epic screenshot stabbing a guy in face, car combat, and whatever you want, Theres also a Video mode, where you can connect a second controller so a friend can record and control the camera to make an awesome cutscene.

The game opens with a beautiful immersive experience with Cam Newton as you take over in a \"scenario\" where the Panthers are taking on the Seahawks in the NFC Championship and you have to guide the Panthers to the win in the final minute. Madden 15 takes another huge step in teaching football concepts with the skills trainer which is huge in teaching the masses how to read defenses, route combinations, passing & running drills. The game teaches how to beat Cover 2, Cover 3, Cover 4, Man which are necessary tools when competing online and reading the complex defenses in the NFL. The legacy issues are still present as they are in all sports games that come out yearly as there are always pressure to put out a new game and sometimes legacy issues are put on the back burner.

You can still throw deep passes but must pick your spots when you do it. I think the game is moving in the right direction.

Well I've been playing Madden ever since I was 10 way back in 1992 and this is the very first Madden that I didnt want to play anymore despite their problems. I had so much hope for this years  edition of madden since the aggressive catch was toned down and with new announcers I figured it just had to be better . I understand the game gets a lot of hate from people saying \"its the same every year\" and I am not one of those people because its football its going to be the same pretty much. This is by far the most bug filled Madden or almost any game I have ever played in my entire life and I've played some terrible games. The new \"features\" are mostly big flopping turds. In order to address the past issue of a qb squirting the ball out animation ea has overcompensated  by making almost every sack becoming a fumble. This does not fix the problem and all it does is substitute 1 bad animation for 1 game breaking one.No qb at any level anywhere would fumble this much. It would easily equate to 35 fumbles per season. How is that realistic? Well it isnt at all.The fact that people can spam the strip ball button to generate a strip is terrible. The way to fix that is if someone spams the button the game makes that player whiff and stumble. It is never a good idea to reward bum players. The same with the interception. People shouldn't be able to spam y or triangle because it should be about reading the offense and making a play on the ball. Middle linebackers are still able to bat and pick balls that would realistically be well over their reach. a linebacker who is 5 yards off the line shouldn't be able to get close to a 25+ yard pass and in real life you would look like a complete moron trying to jump in that situation with your hands out expecting a interception and your coach would throw you into concussion protocol right away. Its nice that ea makes patches during the season to address some of the bugs but games shouldn't be released with day 1 patches in mind as in my mind a game that needs patched and still releasing it is just spotty work and sadly is the norm in the gaming community as a whole and shouldn't be accepted. Instead of fixing glaring legacy issues with the game such as above mentioned mlb issues and warp tackles  the game wants to focus on presentation and the need to change the kicking meter as if that is what the fans were clamoring for. At the end of the day this game is nothing more then a shiny turd. Yes to a review publication it may look all nice for those unearned high review scores but the more you dig into it the more you see and smell that it is just a turd.

Disclaimer:  I'm not that interested in draft/franchise mode or whatever it's called.  I want to play football, not manage a football team.   From a gameplay standpoint, the changes to the mechanics in running actual plays are disastrous.  The additional run controls are so subtle and have to be so exactly executed as to make them worthless.   Worse, if you miss and hit the wrong run influence or your control combination is delayed, you will likely do something much worse, like make the runner stop.   The non-speed version of the controls (without trigger held) are almost sure play-killers because they momentarily stop the runner in his tracks.   As further proof of this problem, we've gone from having way to many  kickoff returns in Madden15 to making it virtually impossible to get a long kickoff return in Madden17.   It's simply impossible to get a good enough juke that you can get past more than one player.  I've played literally hundreds of games of 17 and haven't seen a single long kickoff return (by myself or my opponents).   And what's with the horrible lag on making a QB roll out of the pocket and run?  There are times I've held the control down only to watch the QB stubbornly sit in the pocket, or worse, stutter back and forth from starting to run to trying to pass.  I saw one post suggesting a trick in which you double tap on the control, holding it down the second time.  I have managed to get that to work occasionally to force the QB out of the pocket.  Even then, sometimes he will still stop mid-run and cock his arm back to pass.  For all practical purposes this ability to QB run just no longer works.  It has taken some categories of plays, like many Play Action,  out of the playbook entirely.  Worse, if you want to play a team like the Panthers or Seahawks where a full out QB run is an option, it's impossible.  It has crippled those teams' play.  The pass-catching influencing controls were a great idea, but don't seem to work at all.  Possession catch seems to be the only one that actually does anything (I've never seen Aggressive Catch work, even with very sure-handed receivers).  Similarly, interception defense almost always results in allowing the catch, even with a top-tier cornerback doing it.   So disappointing to see such a digression for this franchise.

The lighting is so poor there's parts of the game you can't explore at night because it's just to dark, I thought maybe this was added as a nice slice of realism, but when the goons could see me and shoot at me, I knew it was just c grade game development. The driving mechanics are shockingly bad and what should be the distinct sound of an American muscle car of that generation, sounds more like a chihuahua trying to pass wind. The sun looks more like a super nova that's on a collision course with earth, it's that unrealistic and blinding. In general the weather affects have that feeling it's 2006 not 2016. It's just a woeful attempt at trying to cash in on the previous 2 mafia games, which I'm not sure that the developers realise, that you actually were a part of the mafia. The soundtrack is great and the cut scenes are some of the best you'll see. Voice acting is very good, not much after that is a positive. it's an open world game, yet you have no interaction with it, you can't buy weapons from shops, food, drink, clothes, haircuts and all the things I thought open world games were about.

If you're looking for more of the same (Mafia 2), big chance you'll be disappointed, too.

It elevates the story from a simple revenge quest to a real authentic journey for the protagonist and it's surrounding cast. The graphics in this game and particularly the cut scenes are also among the best this generation has to offer, especially for an open world.  Graphics and story-wise, this game is superb (did I mention the voice-acting?). However, the gameplay is nothing to write home about.  Missions consists of killing lieutenants and capos of one Mob boss, so then you can kill him. You have to drive to set location, and for the most part kill everyone, and then drive to another location and do the same, over and over again before the game decides you can kill one boss, in order to move to the next boss. Gunplay is your textbook third person shooter and nothing to write home about. The A.I is horrible though, especially in terms of detecting you. Stealth is meh because of it, but is passable. There are a few good things about gameplay though. There are a lot of interesting locations within each mission; For example, I'll be on a cruise ship for one, a firing range for another, a grocery store,etc. The three \"major\" bosses in this game also all have interesting themes and are all unique and fun. I will also add in the driving in this game is on point, it's tight and responsive; however it's a shame the open world is only there for collectibles. I also enjoyed how you can assign your underbosses districts, and the more districts you assign to them, you can gain the list of perks they have to offer (guns, vehicle mods, etc). To end, this game is a big grind fest, but is passable because of the story and interesting themes and locations set within each mission. If you don't care about story in a game and don't like to grind, avoid this game at all costs. If you don't like to grind but enjoy a good story, rent or watch the cut scenes on youtube or something.

Firstly, you'll notice that the facial animations are stunning but as soon as you look at the rest of the world you'll quickly realise it's a total mix of high quality and low quality. The rain and weather effects are generally beautiful but then you'll suddenly see a super low res texture or very noticeable pop-up, or perhaps your characters limbs poking through something they shouldn't be able to pass through. This mixed bag of quality is prevalent throughout the entire game. For instance, while the soundtrack is amazing you'll very quickly be hearing a lot of the same music over and over because there are only 3 radio stations and the content isn't huge. There's a very large open world map with some fairly pretty vistas and towns, but unfortunately there's very little to do other than the story missions which is quite disappointing. It almost seems as if they game is trying to deter you from exploring, and perhaps it is, because lo and behold almost as soon as I decided to roam around, ignoring the missions, and undertaking whatever destruction and fun took my fancy a whole plethora of issues became apparent; NPCs reacting strangely or spouting incorrect responses to what you're doing, getting stuck on a curb because for some reason my character decided he can't climb a 2 inch step anymore, weather cycling too rapidly and then even sometimes key mission triggers not working (I spent about 10 minutes at one point just trying to make a mission start icon actually start the mission). These faults clearly indicate that the game wasn't ready for release, so why they decided to shove it out there I can't imagine. You can't release a AAA game with such glaring issues. I'm not going to return the game, I'll finish it off and get enjoyment out of it for sure, but it's a shame that what could have actually been an absolutely stellar and unique open world adventure is actually just an average game. The feel of the driving mechanics is fine but if you want to have fun driving around the map doing crazy things... well, you won't. Because nothing is designed for casual fun or exploration. The shooting mechanics are functional, but not quite as smooth as they should be. The death animations though are absolutely brilliant, sometimes enemies drop to the ground and writhe around in agony for extended periods of time, begging for help. But for every time something impresses you, two more glitches or shortcomings will rear their head. After watching one enemy react to being hit in the back from a distance, cowering in pain and shock, I then watched him run away and continue fighting as if he hadn't been injured. So the game wows you with something pretty cool but then pulls the rug out from under itself basically showing you a lack of depth in the detail and a lack of cohesion. What's the point in having a bunch of cool little things if the world that contains them doesn't come together properly? This is Mafia III's main issue. There are great little things about it but the overall game hasn't been put together properly; it lacks the polish of a game like GTA V or Red Dead Redemption. It's even more problematic than something like Sleeping Dogs. If you play it, play it for the story, there's nothing else here to write home about, but luckily the story is engrossing enough that many people will choose to ignore the game's faults and push through."], ["Fred059", "User", "5", "Story is great. my only issue with the game was the repetitive missions all of the missions in this game are basically the same. not worth $60 save money and buy it when if its on sale. i cant recommend this even if you are a huge mafia fan."], ["robinzvak", "User", "5", "Wasted potential, avarage game, weak Mafia.

I bought Mafia 3 day one and don't regret my purchase what-so-ever.  The 1960's setting is super interesting to me, not only because of the veitnam war, or the racial tension but because my father who I have a great deal of respect for is a Vietnam vet and pretty much grew up in Louisiana.  So you could say I am a little biased.  The gameplay is there, as well as plenty of content.  Yes, it can get a bit repetitive if you play for several hours at a time, but given that is is a Mob/Mafia revenge game it is going to entail a lot of killing mob/mafia members and that is exactly what you do A LOT.  The voice acting is some of the strongest I have ever heard in a video game, and certainly adds to the immersion.  The cars handle a bit more arcady than I would like.  Hanger 13 has stated, and I am paraphrasing here that \"they wanted the driving to be a bit more arcady so that EVERYONE would be able to drive efficiently.\"  I feel they dropped the ball on this.  If they were looking to make things easier for more casual gamers that is totally cool, but maybe add it as an option to have a more realistic driving experience.  Cars back then were extremely heavy and as big as boats so it completely takes me out of the experience when I am hugging corners at 100 mph in something the size of a small yacht.  I did however love the \"Louisiana Bayou\" setting.  It looks extremely accurate to the time, and when I say accurate of the time I just mean the over all feel of the Bayou.  That kind of mystic/supernatural feeling.  Hangar 13 did an incredible job making New Bordeau (The name of the city in Mafia 3) feel like as big a character as the main one Lincoln Clay.  I completely enjoyed my time with Mafia 3 and I am starting again to see how other options play out (you will know what I mean if you play it, I dont want to give too much away).  I would suggest going into the game reminding yourself that this is a new studio's (Hangar 13) first game ever.  Yes, some of the developers that worked on previous Mafia titles did work on mafia 3 but it's safe to say they were extremely outnumbered.  Also, try not to compare it to GTA 5.  Of coarse GTA 5 looks and feels a lot better, but they have also had a little over 5 chances at fine tuning, and building on their franchise, whereas again this is hangar 13's first title as a studio.

I'm playing on the PS4 so not sure what the other reviews I've seen are for.  I've been playing on consoles for over three years (hey, I was strictly a PC gamer before that.) and I have never had so much trouble in keeping the camera in the middle of the screen.  You turn the stick left and the camera goes up, you push the stick up - the camera goes down.  Really hard to manuever.  I've tried changing the settings but doesn't seem to help much.  Camera also turns really slow so when guys are sneaking up behind you it's hard to turn and get a bead on them.  Have not experienced any bugs yet.  Otherwise, I really bought the game for the New Orleans setting which is fantastic.  I've never played a Grand Theft Auto game but have played Mafia 1 and 2 on PC so I can't compare it to GTV.  I don't think the graphics are that bad, the voice acting is great and the music is fantastic.  I grew up in the 60's and 70's and it's spot on.  Can't comment on the story because I haven't got that far into it yet.  My main complaint is the controls!  Also, the print is very small on the screen so you can't sit comfortably on your couch.  You have to practically be on top of the TV to read it.  They also do not give you any information on how to read the map or what all the symbols mean!!!  Really stupid!  I'm driving by symbols and I have no clue what I'm passing up.  Also they don't explain the symbols on the HUD either.  Some are easy to figure out but others are not.  Nothing in Options menu to explain them.  Also, the on-screen instructions are only up there for about 2 seconds - by the time you scooch up on the couch and get closer to the TV to read them they are gone!  Really annoying.  Driving is not too bad (anything is better than Watch Dogs!) but it's hard to see the traffic lights (might be easier on PC) until you are right on top of them.

Whenever you need to take over a racket, you have to do a bunch of inane **** over and over until you can finally either kill or recruit the racket boss. Now, I consider myself pretty patient when it comes to grind-y gameplay, but it even got to ME. I think the only times I ENJOYED doing those lame side missions where for the Dixie Mob and Southern Union rackets because there was just a sweet kind of irony to it. (and because the Hollow is literally the first district you take over). Now, with that being said, the actual STORY is pretty great and getting revenge on actual lieutenants and capos is satisfying. One or two of them even managed to tug on my heartstrings. I do admit that I missed not being able to customize Lincoln or his cars in any way, though. I think there will be DLC for that, which, thankfully, is free. I also disliked that you could only heal via adrenalin and not get a bite to eat to get it back in between missions or something like it. Or that you could only buy weapons from the back of a fan, although that gets explained. Kind of made all the stores feel kind of redundant.

The setting is amazing and the developers did a great job of conveying the thoughts at the time. Being a black man in the 1960's south means your in for some tough **** White women clutch their purses when you go by, rednecks through empty beer bottles at you, some stores refuse to the server you and the cops eyes are glued to you whenever you roll down the street. These details make the game feel like your in a living, breathing southern city of the 1960's.  Unfortunately, textures can be pretty bad and lighting is an issue.

The story is great as well, it really conveys the story of a rage filled Vietnam vet trying to do right by his stepfather, who is killed by the Italian Mob. By far the weakest part of the game is its main story missions. They feel repetitive, dull and only really come alive when you take down the big gang member in the final fight, the others are just boring. The side missions fare better and feel more natural. But the repetitiveness of the main story missions holds it back from reaching it's full potential. But once you get into combat you find an on-par stealth action game. Cover works well and the stealth is fun. Gunplay feels smooth and the variety of guns make encounters fell different and fun. The music is one of the strongest aspects. All of the listed songs are great and are a joy to listen to. I often find myself driving just a bit farther to finish my song. In conclusion Mafia 3 is worth your money.

All the PC junkies upset that the game was refined with the console in mind more then PC.  Anyways the game is really good and worth a purchase, especially the deluxe edition that comes with the season pass.  The guys @ Hangar 13 are super responsive and seem to be on the ball with updates and adding fan wanted content, which is awesome and not very common.  Also yes this is my first review and that is only because I've never felt compelled to write a review in the past but this game is being vastly underrated on this site.  I will go ahead and say this is the best Campaign I have ever played.  The story is deep here and is vastly untouched in the gaming industry.  The issue of race has been extremely well here and you are going to feel connected to these characters.  Now for the negatives.  Their is no fast travel that is a bit annoying at times (hoping they add this feature soon).  The Graphics here are not earthshattering, while the setting is amazing and the music score is great; clearly not the best graphics to date.  What they did nail with the graphics are the facial animations, they are some of the best I've every seen in a game (if not the best).  The gameplay mechanics are solid if not occasionally dated but honestly if something works then why fix it (Rockstar certainly hasn't changed)?  My actual rating for the game is 8.5/10 for story coming so strong but gameplay occasionally feeling repetitive.  This game though is a must play.

This game is a masterpiece in my mind from the driving to the shooting, and the music is absolutely great too. The game surroundings actually makes me feel like I'm in a time machine back in the late 60's. I don't know what people actually expect from games but what pisses me off is that half of these negative reviews are coming from bandwagon gamers. People that are not true gamers and don't really appreciate the value of a good well out together game so they compare a Mafia game to the likes of destiny, call of duty, and grand theft auto.

The roster is weak and less than week in, casual matches are already near pro levels. So beginners to this game will not enjoy it. Story mode is just like the beta, its weak. From the small roster only five to six players are good to play online. When characters move on screen they feel \"sticky\" and stiff. This changes when combos get started. Heavy characters are trash, go with speed or \"Keep Away\" characters like Dante, Jedah, Zero, Spider-Man, etc. If you are concerned with X-Men characters they're in the game, only disguised as MCU characters. (Example: Gamora is Deadpool/Wolverine). If you have a chance to change the Capcom Asian characters (like Ryu) to native language I recommend it. The English voices are bad dubs.  If you go against players online that has \"Easy Combo\" activated, expect \"one button\" supers. Not a good time.  Presentation is great when the action is going, but idle characters and hair animations are bad. The DLC packs are not worth the wait also, besides the brokenness of the new characters will introduce to the already weak roster (like Killer Instinct did on season 2 on Xbox one).

The members that left had falsified reports made by HR to smear their names after they complained about harassments from the management staff and finally many key staff members that worked on this project didn't get paid with the reason being the extension of the game was more important than their financial benefits.

The character animations are hit or miss, as well as the writing. But if any of you are remembering ME1-3's animations and writing to be amazing works or art, you need to go play them again.

Now for starters let me talk about the writing its....alright sounds a bit like if you read any of the warhammer books cheesy at points but undeniably serious at others. i can forgive the writing mostly because i love jrpg games and a lot off those have some grade a cheesy dialogue. now to the animation, so far i am about 14 hours into the game and while i do see the problems most are technical and can be ironed out. while i cant really say i can forgive these issues at launch i will wait and see what bioware does about it. now onto the characters or should i say models themselves. most arnt bad i to would like to know what happened for real when the females got designd and if anything can be done about it (not unheard of for a developer to tweak model looks in a patch or dlc so hers hopeing). now when all of the hate campains are set aside and the problems are moved from the forefront what lies bare is a very fun game. yes the comparison to dragon age inquisition is a good one because they have some of the same qualities. Both are massive and full of distractions a lot of them are good, a few a bit boring. then there is the combat its fast fluid and sooooo much fun its kinda like vanquish if you have played it. combining gun play and kick ass abilities to just f up some grunts is a joy and i wont get tired of it and that's good for an enormous game like this. look the criticism is justified it needs more than a few patches but when the core game itself and it's concept are good and well executed then i have a lot of hope. While i do agree that Bioware really needed to cut ties with Manveer as soon as the first of his posts went up and i am curious about what they have to say on the topic he does not represent the whole team that worked on the game. as far as the thought about them purposouly making the female characters a bit less attractive to appeal to feminazis all i have to say on that matter is we don't know the whole story nor do we know about weather or not it was souly biowares decision or if pressure form somewhere else came into play.

But i felt they really fumbled on all other aspects of the story. Lame generic villain. Uninteresting crew mates which none had any charisma besides peebee. The cora romance didn't feel like a romance at all. No chemistry with ryder at all. It was basically flirt with her during conversations, do a few loyalty missions for her and thats it. Then you get to have sex with her once. When i reached the last mission i was a bit surprised i was already at the end of the game. I did do quite a few side missions and the campaign still felt unusually short. Overall i regret buying the deluxe version of the game. I actually regret buying the game at all.

There is hardly any thread of a decent story line in Andromeda, the characters are pretty linear, and the dialogue comes off as fan fiction at times.  I, personally, can look the other way with small amount of bad animations, but for a Bioware game with a terrible story, dialogue (plenty of examples, Liam's banter about shooting a guy in the face in the earlier scene, Sara Ryder talking to Suvi, etc.) , and characters?

Liam and Cora are awful: Liam's always talking about how he's crying about this or that; Cora likes to drone on about her asari training.

The idea became to go to the neighbour galaxy with a select few species from the original trilogy, a new protagonist and a new set of circumstances.

It's Mass Effect: The Force Awakens, all with a Mary Sue protagonist whose unsure and sometimes immature characterization (as a result of being 7 years younger than Shepard) is completely at odds with the incredible power-level the story grants him (or her). The coolest thing regarding the outset of the plot is that you have a sister and a dad who are both customizable to some extent and a few surprises down the road, but ultimately it doesn't mean much because it's still just a retelling of ME1; you have a the Neo-Geth, Neo-Reapers, Neo-Council, Neo-Saren all hidden under different names and art-directions such as the bony aliens called \"The Kett\" and the ominous, almost otherworldly force that threatens all existence called \"The Scourge\".

The gameplay was better than previous game as well as how the game looked except for the facial animations. The story is weaker than previous games as well as the characters, the multiplayer stayed the same as before.

It is without a doubt one of the worst games in recent years. It already starts at character creation. The faces are simply ugly. There is no other way to put it and no amount of editing can make them attractive. It is so bad that it renders the game almost unplayable. I literally had to start a new game with a different face 5 times before I finally had created a face that was somewhat bearable. That's ridiculous for a RPG. It's the first time that has ever happened to me. I've altered the settings so that the character's helmet is on most of the time, which helps somewhat. But there are still cutscenes where the helmet is removed. Of course if that was the only thing wrong with the game it would be something to overcome and perhaps fix in a future patch, but sadly there is much, much more wrong with it. The story is almost non-existent, the NPC's are uninteresting, the side quests are boring and is most cases simply an exercise in futility. The replay value is limited because there are no class restrictions. One of the great things about the previous Mass Effect games was that you could play them again as a different class and get a completely different game experience. But in this game it is all lumped together. As a Vanguard you can specialize in skills of an Infiltrator, or an Engineer, or a Biotic. It completely ruins the replayability. And you get so many skill points (I easily reached level 62 on my first playthrough) that you can try out pretty much every skill you want and still have points to spare. It's ridiculous. The game is also filled with bugs that sometimes even cause quests to break or hang. The first patch has actually made things worse. The AI in your head won't shut up. Telling you the temperature is below freezing, and then normal again, and then below freezing again, and then normal again, and so on. But that very same information is already on the screen, so there is no need for the AI to tell you about it. It's just purely annoying. As an experienced gamer you will know what to do as soon as you enter a location. And you'll do it. But in this game you will enter a location, see the terminal that you have to activate and then wait for a minute while your AI explains to you in an excruciatingly slow voice that you have to activate the terminal. This game is completely void of any thing that makes it interesting. The game keeps you busy, but at no point does it entertain. This game is the complete opposite of the previous Mass Effect games. Those were great, this is garbage. Even if a future patch fixes the bugs, gives you the option to shut your AI up, makes the faces of the player character less ugly, it still leaves you with a terribly designed game that is boring an annoying. If you absolutely must buy this game and see for yourself how bad it is, don't buy it now as you can get it a discount soon enough.

The story, although engaging, lacks the thought provoking plot that was present in ME 1 in regards to the introduction of world, finding clues, and uncovering a conspiracy. The characters of ME:A for the protagonist, squad mates, and other NPCs are interesting, but they do not bring the same attachments that were felt in ME 2 and 3. When tragedy hits or there is a sense of urgency for example, our protagonist and others lack real emotions such as anguish or anxiety that would undoubtedly be present in fleshed out characters.

The pros of the game are the vast amount of content, gorgeously crafted planets, fun exploration and very fun shooting/combat mechanics.  The cons as most have pointed out are the poor cut scene animations and in some instances worse dialogue than the previous M.E. games though some of the dialogue is excellent and some is poor, so it's a mixed bag that overall ends of being pretty decent.  Another con is the clunky UI at times as well, Bioware made doing simple things a bit too difficult in certain instances (like crafting and the quest layout), but because there is so much to do and so much going on in the game it is somewhat understandable.  The male Ryder animations seem to be better than the female Ryder for some strange reason.  The graphics of the worlds in the game are absolutely incredible, you will find yourself admiring the beauty and vastness of the planets often if you are like me (this is something I did in M.E. 2 and 3 as well, but with the advanced technology nowadays this game obviously blows them away on that level).  There are certainly a lot of things to like about the game and I think if you are a die-hard RPG fan who loves huge games with tons of content and an intriguing premise, as well as people who love sci-fi in general I would certainly recommend the game to you.  Content, fun factor, and exploration are far more important elements of RPG's than graphics and cut scene animations so because the game nails the important parts of an RPG I feel the game deserves a good rating.  The cut scene animations aren't that bad either, they end of being pretty mediocre, which is unfortunate but they truly don't take away from the insane amount of fun to be had exploring a brand new galaxy and the very compelling narrative ( I mean, come on, starting a civilization on a different galaxy, that's pretty cool)!"], ["X_Kill", "User", "8", "I had a great time with the game.

I would like to remind people that the writing in that DLC was pretty juvenile with hilariously stupid one liners and didnt really take itself all that seriously. This game has the exact same appeal, and left me with a lot of moments of where I had a good laugh.

It will really depend on the player and what he or she can tolerate and what they can\u2019t.  The one thing that can\u2019t be fixed would be it\u2019s writing.  Mass Effect Andromeda puts you in a new galaxy with new planets, but fails to match the wonder and excitement of discovery by making characters say the WORST possible things at the WORST possible times.

Apparently, I was wrong. Andromeda is a terrible game that falls flat in almost all areas. One of these would be the story. One of the biggest praises I see about the original trilogy is that it the games have incredible stories, while Andromeda's feels like it was thrown together last minute. None of the characters managed to interest me for extended periods of time, and most of them were really generic, bland, lifeless beings with nothing special about them. This is especially conveyed through the game's facial animations, that I won't talk about because you don't need me to tell you about it. It also didn't help that the characters were voiced by some of the most talentless people in the industry, not including Natalie Dormer and Kumail Nanjiani. However, a lot of games have been able to push aside a flawed story with incredible gameplay. So has Andromeda done that? Well, no, not really. The combat is extremely dull and not very fleshed out, and fighting the same enemies over and over again didn't make it better. Also, for some reason, BioWare decided that it would be a glorious idea to make the game open world. This didn't help the game, either, and actually hurt it in some aspects. For starters, the poor world design, in terms of structure and layout or the map, was repeated constantly on every planet I came across. I barely saw a change in an overall world, and the fact that the maps were very limited in where you could go when the game was advertised to be all about the freedom of the player really crippled my experience with the game. Traversing this travesty of a game map is also a pain in the ass, as the Nomad can barely go up a slightly steep hill without you having to switch into 6 wheel mode, and the customisation is way too limited and unimagined. But enough about the main game, let's discuss the multiplayer. It's not good. On a technical level, I'd compare it to Assassin's Creed Unity levels of functionality. Matchmaking is almost instantaneous, but there are constant song bugs and frame drops that seemed to happen every match, at least in my experience. In addition to that, there's only two game modes, neither of which are worth your time. Also, because it's published by EA, the multiplayer is loaded with microtransactions. The only good thing I could say about this game is that the customisation in the single player, in terms of armour and weapons, is pretty spot on, but nothing else besides that. In conclusion, Mass Effect Andromeda is the most boring, monotonous and overall awful AAA game I've played since The Division.

No. Is it still worth playing? I'd say yes.

Patch 1.5 made the animations and some textures feel almost brand new compared to launch, so that in itself shows the game is improving. Other released future patch notes also show a lot of promise. If you want to base your purchase of this game off of the reviews, that's absolutely fine, but in my opinion you can't tell if you're going to like a game or not until you actually play it. This is one of those \"give it a chance\" games. Overall (although I'm a huge Bioware fan so I may have some bias) I recommend the game - even if you wait for more updates before buying.

Using the jet pack to climb structures and dash around is a blast. The exploration is also very fun. I love exploring the huge planets and finding enemy bases and caves. Also finding side quests on each planet makes exploration rewarding, especially since side quests award some nice experience points and other rewards. Even the side quests are mostly interesting. They add a lot of lore to the game and make you care more about the characters. Even the fetch quests and monster hunts are interesting because they usually have some story element to them that adds to the lore in some way.

Are there flaws? yes, but they are less apparent the further you get in the game. Do the human like characters(this includes asari) look derpy? yes, does it need work? yes. Are all games perfect on launch? no. From what I've seen in my life as a gamer no game is 100% perfect off the start, this isn't the days of old school where you had to get it right off the bat. With today gaming publishers can patch as they go, players just need to voice feedback. Will the flaws get fixed? pretty sure they've said a patch is on the way, or in the works. Anyways, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but atleast make informed reviews after actually playing the game. Most people seem to be trash talking the game for the sake of trash talking it, because it's the in thing to do. Now if you actually played the game and decided you didn't like it fine, personally i'm enjoying myself greatly. The campaign is fun and new, combat is sleek and fluid, and multiplayer is a blast.

Since most reviews I'm seeing are referring to the SP portion of the game, i thought I'd throw my opinion out there for anyone interested in MP.  MP is not terrible, but it's not nearly as good as ME3 MP was.  Overall, if feel much clunkier.  The button layout has changed, which makes it less intuitive in my opinion.  Gone is the platinum setting, so only  bronze, silver, and gold remain; however, the waves seem harder.  The same basic character progression is in place (six skill levels, first 3 with one skill, and the next 3 with 2 skills of which you choose 1).  Leveling points are the same as well.

Andromeda is not a bad game, its not a good game either.   The sites, the exploration and the graphics are where the goods are in this game.

The game takes almost no risk, carefully dodging anything related to Mass Effect 3's ending or Commander Shepard. Ryder does enough though his voice acting is in need of drastic improvements going forward. You get the vibe, especially with male Ryder that he isn't taking any of this seriously and its just hard to get behind him/her as a character when they don't bring much to the table.

This game is by no means perfect and without so many overly critical reviews from people who want everything in the story spelt out for them, I would have been more critical. This game is clearly meant to be the opening act of a trilogy (just like ME1) and therefore is less fast paced and spends a lot of time establishing the narrative needed for later games.

The hate this title receives probably stems from the still failed promise of the Mass Effect franchise as a whole (and ME3's ending specifically) where choices made across multiple games effect the ultimate outcome.  On its own, however, it's great.  As for its political themes, Bioware has never shied away from such, but maybe some ME fans weren't old enough to realize this before?  The story of refugees seeking asylum from a war-torn homeland may be unique to gamer, but it serves as an interesting reflection of today's cultural climate.... and that's one of the things sci-fi does best, places a mirror to ourselves and asks what if?  The backlash against such a storyline is a sign of our political climate, not any change on the Bioware's part... regardless of who's the head of the writing team.  Sure, day one had some hiccups, but the updates have patched most everything that drove down its initial score.  One more note: the hoopla against the default female Ryder is ridiculously immature, and if adolescent gamers wishing to capitalize on the male gaze didn't know, you can customize the look and gender of your character all you want.

Interaction in dialog is heavily reduced from the previous entries and the facial animations have taken a huge step backward to a point where the game is immersion breaking and unintentionally hilarious, however, when the game does attempt to be humorous with inappropriately timed jokes amid combat it makes even the most cringe worthy of disney jokes seem passable.

My only big concerns are that the game lags in certain instances and you can only have a single save file for each game.

The gameplay is the same except you can run by pressing L3 which is(in my own opinion) weird to due in a metal gear game.

I want to say that this camp is snakes personal play ground but there's so little to do in it besides sneak around,go all out or die! Almost all buildings are locked! But you can enter vehicles which, in retrospect, makes this worse since there's little to do in your environment. The camo system has been removed and replaced with...um....nothing! They also removed the boxes,bandages,rations, back pain meds,stamina gage when hanging and just about anything else that made metal gear solid...well...metal gear solid. This games atmosphere is far from any metal gear game,meaning, i didnt feel like i was playing metal gear but some sort of cheap knock off of metal gear! Why? Well, everytime you vet noticed, the game slows down time for you, giving you MORE than enough time to head shot any enemies who spotted you thus ending the alarm status if successful and you will be successful, and this is where this demo differs from previous entries in this great series. The metal gear mood has been replaced with your typical main stream third person shooter. Automatic health regen takes away the strategy that came with rations....i dont care about this game being short because this is nothing more than a cash grab demo which i rented.

Only about 30 hours later and after nights of sleeplessness where I tried to figure out why I wasn't satisfied with the game it hit me. There is no heart to it. The gameplay sure ist pretty good and it is a lot of fun. The world's are empty though and Kojima Productions had no idea how to make an open world that is diverse and feels natural. The worst part of this game is without a doubt the story. The first chapter was somehow bearable, although it felt so unfinished and things that got introduced were never explained or continued later on. The second chapter though is the worst part. It feels like they needed to throw everything they had left together just to make the story a little bit longer in the end. Quiet is an awful character and I don't feel ashamed for my \"words and deeds\" about her attire but that I actually defended her all this time only to learn about the utterly stupid reason she's wearing a bikini in battle. I feel ashamed for playing this game when I see her weird, hyper-sexual movements in some cutscenes and especially that stuff in the rain. The forced romance between her and 'Snake' that the story tries to shove down your throat somewhere in the middle of the game, again with no build up is so painful and cringe-worthy to look at. Also there is nothing controversial in this game that hasn't been done in other games already. Children with guns? In The Last of Us you play as a child while you're murdering people. Now I know child-soldiers are a real thing but it's so weirdly implemented in this game and doesn't really add much. Quiet being almost raped and tortured? Well that is a bad thing but the fact that men get raped too is not acknowledged at all. These scenes just feel like the game is forcing you to feel sorry for her all of a sudden. Skull Face is a silly, pathetic character that feels almost unimportant to the story. I could go on for hours. The thing that I hate most about this game is that stupid twist at the end that creates more plot-holes than it does actually explain something. It's just so stupid and unnecessary. There is no downfall of Big Boss. He doesn't become evil because of the events he has to go through.

Why is that? First, it's an open world game. Now mind you, I have nothing against open world games. Open world games can be a blast if done right. Since this is the first time Metal Gear has gone open world, I had high expectations that they'd not only meet but exceed their competitors when it came to creating a world that you actually want to explore. I mean, what is the point of making an open world game if it's not interesting to traverse? If you're not going to do that, just make it a linear game like prior games in the series and perfect each space by littering them full of interesting things to see and do. And here is my first complaint with Metal Gear Solid 5. The open world is uninteresting. You have Africa and Afghanistan. Both overly brown, void of much life, and little to hold your interest while moving throughout the world. While there are side missions sprinkled throughout the world, the side missions are, sadly enough, entirely filler content that does little to add to the game. Actually, they sort of detract from the game overall. Instead of creating a linear, narrative-driven Metal Gear Solid, they've created an open world, one that doesn't have anything interesting going on in it, and then try to throw in some copy & paste side missions that are incredibly uninteresting and by-the-numbers in their design. But, then, the story must be good, especially if you're a Metal Gear fan, right? Wrong. For whatever reason, Konami replaced their old voice actors with new, more recognizable actors. For example, instead of David Hayter, we get Kiefer Sutherland. Not only does his performance fail in comparison to Hayter's, he rarely even talks throughout the game. And here's another issue, there's barely any cutscenes compared to the prior Metal Gear's. While I'll concede that prior Metal Gear's may have been overkill when it came to cutscenes, but they've swung the pendulum so far from that that there's not enough now. I do agree that the gameplay here is solid and enjoyable, but when the world it takes place in, the narrative that surrounds, and the extra content is so poor, I can't give it praise that it simply doesn't deserve. If you're a fan of open world games, this will disappoint you. If you're a fan of Metal Gear Solid's past, this will disappoint. As a fan of both, I'm floored that people are giving this game high marks. I can only surmise that it's because people were really hyped about it and now they're forgiving issues that they'll soon come to dislike. As is the case very often with people who play games and people who write about them, they sometimes overlook glaring issues when they release and then only come to grips with the fact that the game wasn't all that years down the road.

Let me start by saying that metal gear solid 5 is definitely an incredible game, and is unlike any other game ever  made and probably unlike anything that will  ever be made. the gameplay  is undoubtedly the strongest and most incredible part of the game. No other game uses an open world environment  as a part of the gameplay as well as the phantom pain. exploring the beautiful open deserts of Afghanistan and the wet jungles and barren plains of Africa is fun but what makes the open world so great is how its terrain, weather, time of day and enemy bases placed in the world plays a huge role in how you decide to go about your missions and the enormous amount of resources and gadgets you have at your disposal gives an endless amount of gameplay styles and options while in the field.  the game leaves everything up to you and does not hold your hand at all, allowing you create your own war stories unique to you. I genuinely feel that any one else who plays this game will have a completely different experience than I did when it came to how they went about completing their missions and that's pretty freaking awesome, in fact this has alot to do with the games key themes that are reveled at the end of the game, which I will not spoil for you. every mission is memorable and well directed and realized and are extremely enjoyable, until you get into the post game, which is my biggest issue of the game. unfortunately the director of the game hideo kojima did not get all the time he needed to finish the game how he intended, and the game was rushed by the publishers of the game. This left the last ten or so missions being recycled missions from earlier in the game with the difficulty of the missions being ramped up. this is extremely disappointing because the meat of the story is in these final chapters of the game and the narrative doesn't flow at all because the missions don't translate into whats going on near the end and its such a shame that we couldn't play the missions kojima could have made if he was given the time. The story of the game is the most controversial topic it seems when it comes to the game, which I wont spoil, but I will say the main story until the post missions start is pretty straight forward and easy to follow. The cut scenes are beautifully directed and the voice acting is superb, and the main story is actually quite compelling even though it doesn't have the amount of revelations and plot twists fans may have expected, but the incredibly profound ideas and themes the franchise is known for is still all there in spades, especially in the post game. The post game and ending are where people are really divided on this game, and when I played through the ending of this game, I was dumbfounded by the twist and to be honest quite angry, but after a day or two thinking about it and trying to figure out what kojima was trying to do with this ending, I ended up loving it and I feel that much like metal gear solid 2, people are going to be really upset about it for a while, but as the years go by and people think about it more, people are going to appreciate what the ending was trying to do and I think people will start seeing how incredible of a game and a work of art this game is.

However, where the game suffers is with its story. Its not that it is bad, it just doesn't really compare that well to what i have heard from other Metal Gear Games (Especially in Chapter 2). Also, it has been pretty much confirmed that an ENTIRE CHAPTER of this game has been cut out. Because of this, i kind of got this emptiness feeling. I never got to figure out what truly happened with a specific character that I promise not to spoil. Yes,Yes, you can see a partially completed ending on the Special Edition of the Version, but it makes a huge difference that it actually isn't in the game. But at the same time, I did still get a lot of time and enjoyment out of this game.

I particularly liked the walkman thing (aka. the ipod of the 80's) it was a nice touch. Overall the detail and polish of the graphics held up through thick and thin.

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an amazing experience that takes you on a long but satisfying journey through the deserts and mountains of Afghanistan and through the plains and jungles of Africa. The Phantom Pain takes place 9 years after the fall of the legendary hero Big Boss and his mother base. Waking up from his 9 year coma and thirsty for revenge, Big boss rides off to seek his vengeance. The story of The Phantom Pain while not the main priority like previous installments it is still amazing ride and still manages to live up to the interesting story telling that series creator Hideo Kojima always manages to deliver. The gameplay however is the main focus in The Phantom Pain: with the Open world it allows you as the player to infiltrate on you're terms. To further let you go wild is the countless weapons, tools, items, supply drops, helicopter support, air strikes, and of course the cardboard box. the game also allows you to bring along four companions, D horse, D walker, D dog, and Quiet. Build up mother base by fulton extracting soldiers and resources you find in the open world. GMP allows you to develop weapons and tools, to outfits, to equipment for you're buddies, to supply drops to the field, to building platforms for mother base and ETC. All of this allows you to play the game how you want to play. Want to fly in on your chopper gunning down enemies, shoot your way in, call in an air strike and shoot your way out while Quiet picks of enemies from a distance with her sniper rife then jump on the chopper and ride off in the sunset while the air strike finishes the job? or sneak your way through using D dog to sniff out enemies and tag them for you as you slither your way through, unseen hiding the body of the soldier you just put to sleep in a dumpster or porta potty, and use the cardboard box to hide in plain side while you wait for a truck to hop in the back of while it drives you into the heart of the base? use D dog to distract, kill, stun or wound the guard in in your path? the possibilities are endless.

However this issue is something that can probably be patched in the future. The second issue that you may experience with the game is that it seems as though the over-arching storyline takes a backseat to the episodic storylines you play though.

After that it's straight game play, the first 20 hours left me asking for more cut scene!

Given the vast amount of exploration and seem less control between the open world and Mother Base, it's actually a great medium to listen in on some of the on-goings in the background as you're trying to organise your Mother Base staff, initiate your men into war, locate resources etc. But if you're a die-hard MG fan, my advise to you is; put everything you know aside when playing this game. I'll give you ten bucks if you don't drop your jaw in awe for the environment that you explore, the animation of the characters that are almost lifelike, the gorgeous graphics and even the added Mother Base missions and extra Side Ops.

From the very beginning mission the game has a deep deep feel for situational discomfort, you aren't comfortable with that's happening, but this is done in a way that both excites you and scares you. You don't want to run into an enemy base but you also wonder if there are any diamonds there so you can create a larger Mother Base. It's things like this that really make the game shine as a stealth simulation, an experience where you actually feel like you are infiltrating something much larger than yourself."], ["fishandcheese", "User", "10", "Best game ever!

It is a game that dares to push boundaries and to be truly ambitious where far too many developers and their series are far too comfortable stagnating with each iteration of their respective series. Whether you are a long time fan of the series, a newcomer, or even someone who found previous titles in the series weren't really your thing, or just outright disliked them, I implore you to try this game, really try it. I say this because it is one of the only instances in gaming history where a series has made such an incredibly and surprisingly massive leap forward, not only for the series itself, but more importantly for gaming as a whole. This is the kind of game that sets a standard, this is the kind of game that's merits can not be simply measured by the sum of it's parts. I can only hope, and pray that other gamers will look at this game as a shining example of the difference between a game that is produced with true care and creativity, with ambition behind it and innovation pushing it forward and making it a reality, and games that are just yearly releases of the same old **** running on dated engines, with barely any real change save for new maps and a new generic story, pushed out too early and often buggy and incomplete, with withheld content planned as DLC's right from the start."], ["shm0", "User", "10", "This game is a masterpiece.

Forcing Snake to make drastic changes into becoming a more misunderstood anti-hero even by his own men, who begin questioning his leadership when he's making outrageous decisions making more of them betray him, but Skull Face using you by blaming everything on Zero so you'll fight against him and when this is found it is too little too late as now the entire world is against Diamond Dogs who change them selves into Outer Heaven.

Here however you can choose your own play style and no matter what you'll be satisfied, levels or environments are intelligently made to approach stealthily and it's amazing to have the feeling of completing a main mission with no detection or kill satisfying. And it becomes more amazing when the game intelligently makes it harder for you by studying your behavior and setting up 'barriers' (i.e. claymore placed on routes you take when sneaking, or combat armor on soldiers if your too violent) making it so you have to experiment more with different items that you research, and if becomes too difficult for you, you can send combat units from your staff to stop an enemy line of supply (send them on a mission to destroy supplies for mines and if successful you won't see mines for while)."], ["JayLightBar", "User", "9", "The Phantom Pain is the finale send off for my favorite games director of all time.

I wouldn't be able to tell you one god damned thing I remembered about it either.  All I can say is I enjoyed the gameplay but had no idea what was going on,  I digress.  A friend suggested to play all of the MGS games just so that I could fully appreciate Phantom Pain.  So after many months I have finally completed my journey.  I can honestly relate to some of the die hard MGS fan's gripes about Kojima taking the more mainstream approach with TPP, I still consider this game to be ONE of the best.  If you are a die hard fan you will see that TPP definitely lacks that \"kojima weird\" writing style, imo this is easily forgivable due to the immensely entertaining gameplay.  I would honestly say that even if you haven't played any MGS games this is still worth your time and money.  Kojima found a way to make resource gathering a lot of fun.  I have been in several situations where I didn't have time to properly play certain missions, I could still hop on for a few minutes to gather all necessary resources to upgrade me base of operations and develop new weapons.  With hundreds of different weapons, a respectable amount of different tools, and vehicles TPP gives you the opportunity to experiment with several different play styles, and THOUSANDS of different ways to complete missions.  I believe this helps the game stay \"fresh\".  One thing I noticed about this game which imo is super underrated is the A.I.  Your enemies are super smart.  After a while you will see enemies start to adapt to your certain play style.  For instance, if you clear out an enemy camp by shooting each one of them in the head with the tranq gun, the next time you visit a camp they will be wearing helmets.  There are several other factors as well but I don't want to give too much away.

Were is all the stuff to do in the open world, its like your in a wasteland occupied by a few spare soldiers, there are no side missions to stumble on. I also hated the episodic way the game progresses, there is no flow, every time I get a mission done I get pulled out of the world and have to pick the next episode, I liked the flowing progression of the other games, were you wouldn't have to go from mission to mission, it was all one story and you picked your own way to get to the end. There are also parts that force you to redo missions on harder difficulties or do pointless side missions to get the next actual story mission....Really Konami? The Mother Base concept should have stayed on the Vita, its a fun diversion, but by no means should be the main goal or tide so deeply with the story. It seemed like every time I'd get to a mission id be more worried about getting some B or A ranked soldier out for Mother Base instead of progressing the story, because if I don't get the soldier out, my mother base will suck and limit all the weapons, equipment, and camo that I can obtain. It boils down to a ****ty card playing game were the soldiers are the cards. I'm not big on playing games with AI companions (I'm level 3 lone wanderer in FO4) I'm the star of this show, but the companions in the game are pretty cool and are integrated in the game well with multiple camo's and weapons for each person. Still, Snake roles solo and it would have been better if they hadn't been added. The villains in this game are also notoriously ****ty, not to mention that most characters are from other MGS titles and the one original character (Skull Face) isn't hashed out at all and dies half way through the game very unceremoniously.

This game was made for all the people who like to mindlessly shoot **** with no motive or story involved because they don't like long cut-scenes, but I submit that Metal Gear is nothing without its story driven campaign, half hour cut-scenes that paint beautiful and sinister story plots, and its partial linear qualities, so I morn the death of one of the greatest video game series of all time"], ["stamito", "User", "7", "As a game this is good stuff, as a metal gear it is a bit disappointing and I\u2019ll explain why."], ["Drakej24", "User", "6", "If you fell in love with MGS1-2-or-3, I advise caution for this game.

Each and every Metal Gear game I've enjoyed greatly. My personal favorite being MGS3 mostly because of the characters. Thats one thing in this game you wont be seeing...anyone with any real personality or interesting traits. They all seem so stock and stiff with everything they do. Snake in this title is border line a silent protagonist which is beyond insane giving the amount of dialogue and cut scenes this series is known for. The story in this title is without doubt put on the back burner which is a huge disappointment to any true Metal Gear fan. MGS5 is a first for the series in that its an open world title. The open world in this game is.....a boring empty hollow husk with reused environments over and over again. This is one thing wrong with the title....repetition. Its shocking how stale and boring this game can become, whether its the same old boring stock missions you rinse and repeat multiple times just to get to be able to play a story mission. Or seeing the same old reused bases that you infiltrated fifty times over in the past ten hours. You will surely be in shock at how boring you will find this game to be after a good 10 hours of play time. Its so strange because its intro is one of the strongest I've seen in the series...then it all goes downhill from there. Getting into the game play though this title truly does have the best game play I've seen in really any shooter series. Its so fluent and satisfying to shoot an enemy and there is so much to do game play wise its hard to name everything off. More or less if you are a game play fanatic and don't care for much of anything else this title is for you. Metal Gear fans however were put in the back burner I'm afraid due to how much content was taking out. I find that all of these near perfect reviews whether its from professionals or just users. I imagine them mostly to be from people who never were fully invested into the series like I was and many others. If you are a real Metal Gear fan you in no way shape or form could give this title anything beyond a 7/10. For example if you were to remove the Metal Gear title, get rid of Snake and turn this game into a stand alone title I'd probably give it a strong 8.5/10. The problem is this is a Metal Gear title! Its lost so many of its traits that I just can't enjoy it. To put into perspective how mediocre the story is here is a brief example.

That hasn't changed after playing The Phantom Pain. In aspects this game is fantastic. The graphics, the stealth, the slow-mo when spotted by an enemy was also a great addition.. there's a list of things I can name that I enjoyed about the game. But then here lies the problem.... none of these things were necessarily the things that made MGS so special. This game is missing the linear feel of getting sucked into a major story that unfolds as you progress - instead, you can completely lose track of any story as you get to choose when and where to progress. Which brings me to the absolutely pointless part of the game giving credits after every completed mission. What's the point? Now to the story.... of which I really wished I cared about in this game, but sadly I didn't. Where was the emotion? The music which used to make cutscenes so epic was so minimal, and if there was a cutscene I probably missed it as I got sidetracked and had a toilet break as I was bored to tears. I really wished I'd loved this game. I feel a 6/10 is generous considering how much I felt let-down by the whole experience. I'm sure other true MGS fans feel the same."], ["Termin8ter", "User", "8", "Metal Gear Solid V is the very definition of a mixed bag. While the stealth and gameplay mechanics are practically superb and fantastic, the story suffers heavily, is structured very poorly, and has bland characters. The game opens right where Ground Zeroes left off, Big Boss wakes up from a 9 year coma in 1984. The opening is puzzling, interesting and quite nightmarish, and it really introduces people to the Metal Gear universe and Kojima's wild imagination and style. From there, you build up your Mother Base under a new PMC called Diamond Dogs and take revenge on Skullface. But to best honest with you, If you are a newcomer to the Metal Gear Solid franchise, or even a fan who hasn't bought the game yet, I would not recommend you buy this game for the story. If you wanna buy it for the perfect and expertly-crafted stealth mechanics, go ahead. But do not buy this game if you want to enjoy a great story because you will not find one here. Why? A few reasons. 1. Kojima being bored of making MGS games. He has been forced by Konami to continually make them, and felt he had to because he couldn't find anyone who could succeed him, and the one person who could, died of cancer. No joke. So, with MGSV Kojima decided to focus only on making a good STEALTH game, and barely gave any interest to the story. 2. Konami mucking around and getting needlessly involved with Kojima Productions' development process, which caused chunks of the game to be unfinished when they shouldn't have been. 3. Konami pushing the game out the door when the story wasn't truly finished. So there. You can find heaps of videos and comments on YouTube criticizing the game's plot. I'll repeat myself one more time to hit the nail through the plank of wood. Do not buy this game for the story. Overall, MGSV is a great stealth action game but has a lackluster story, which Is a shame because MGS has always espoused great stories. But I guess It's a testament to what happens if a man is forced to make something he was finished with decades ago. Now that Kojima has established his new Kojima Productions and partnered with Sony, and has announced his next ambitious project, Death Stranding, I'm quite glad his involvement with the franchise is over."], ["Jake92", "User", "9", "Metal Gear Solid 5 Phantom Pain Review"], ["badgerryan19", "User", "8", "Well the wait is over for another MGS game directed by Hideo Kojima.

The music is just awful and generic, far from some of the epics fans of the Metal Gear series have come to expect.

There aren't many modes to mix the game up and as far as I can tell the bread and butter of the game is to win matches to get new gear to slightly upgrade your character to take on harder missions. It's a slog to unlock any useful items made even more tedious by the repetitive and uninspired tower defense/survival gameplay. The gameplay feels unpolished and it's missing most if not all the Kojima flair fans of the series have come to expect.

The story of the Metro and Artyom is an exciting thriller, and if you have not played it, now is the time. The story  engulfs you, but not with huge explosions and jaw dropping action. However, it is the atmosphere of this universe. The characters, the feeling of sneaking past mutants, not knowing whats around the next corner, and the visuals (especially on next gen). The first time you exit from the darkness of the Metro into the nuclear wasteland of Moscow the feeling is incredible. The outside is not any safer though as the wasteland is covered with mutants, and you survive by gas mask to keep safe from the toxic air. Metro has a very special feel to its game play as well. The series does an exquisite job of balancing the survival aspect without making you beg for ammo after every encounter. Redux also gives you the option to play the game like a more fast paced FPS like Call of Duty by choosing the games \"Spartan Mode\" which is good if you do not prefer the survival aspect of the series.  Weapon upgrades like adding night vision scopes or making your double barrel shogun a quad barrel also play a big part to the game play. While not unique the upgrades do feel like a nice addition to some already pretty solid gun play. The different enemies and situations Redux throws at you will also allow to take full force of your weapon arsenal, whether its a silenced pistol, an LMG, or flamethrower.

But, this game goes beyond what Batman offers in the combat scheme as the addition of \"Wraith\" skills makes combat something incredible to see once you get all the nuances down.

The story was also really good as well, although at times it felt a bit thrown together (you can approach certain missions in whatever order you want, so branching side-stories can feel lost in the overall narrative). My only major gripe is that after the campaign is finished the side missions (archer, sword, dagger and outcast missions) dont have enough variety to sustain 5-10hrs of grinding.

That does not necessarily mean that it disappoints, but that it leaves you wanting more. You get this feeling that the main story messes up what you already know from either the books or the movies (most common). My personal \"Story\" score would be a 7 or 8 out of 10. Of course, this game received good critic from major reviewers for a reason, and that reason is everything else excluding the \"Main Story\" of the game. This includes the fantastic gameplay with your epic sword, your ghostly bow, and finally your brutal stealthy dagger. Even more fun are the abilities that you have from being a \"Wraith\" where you are tremendously fast and blow you opponents heads off continuously. It is extremely fluid and responsive in every situation. There is nothing else to say about the gameplay since it is difficult to understand just from a review how impeccable it really is. This game was created, in my opinion, to introduce the \"Nemesis System\". Even though it is really easy to understand what it is doing while playing the game, I will just say this: Every kill you make, counts. Every kill your opponents make, especially counts! You could be fighting some random \"Uruk\" while exploring Mordor, and something happens and leads to your death. The random (could had avoided death) Uruk that killed you will now become a \"Captain\" and all the other \"Captains\" will increase there level. The thing is that if you are not careful while playing, and are constantly dying, the \"Captains\" can become a huge issue, getting into a point where they are totally harder than a \"War-chief\" (Commander of Captains). You might not understand what this means (not until you get the game), but basically keep in mind that you receive rewards to upgrade Talion , but think of his deaths as a \"Double-Punishment Treat\". You can always be able to kill even the hardest opponent, but don't expect it to be as easy as you might think since at that point, they will be invulnerable to simply everything."], ["sgtdegrandis", "User", "8", "this games is tons of fun however the biggest flaws are the QTE final boss battles also the missions themselves are just tutorials which is ok but i wish there was more to them also the story was not very interesting."], ["MasiTronXIII", "User", "9", "I didn't know much about Shadow of Mordor going into it, but when you get started, this game simply feels incredible, running around Mordor in itself on next gen machines looks fantastic.

The biggest knock on this game is it can get a bit repetitive sometimes. If you are a Lord of the rings fan, or a fan of the Arkham series, like myself, you will probably love this game. It's smooth and beautiful and a great step up on the next gen consoles. The nemesis system is incredible, within 2 hours I had been killed 6 times by one foolish uruk who made his way up the ranks, eventually I got revenge, only for him to come back with a face wound and for our battle to continue.

Also there are lots of collectibles and additions to complete. One of the most interesting things is also the way Sauron's army has its own living hierarchy. For an instance, if you die at the hands of an Orc boss, he will be rewarded with a higher Rank and you will see this in a screen that shows the current army's status, but also other Orcs can kill between them or the recently upgraded ones, taking their ranks. These things make them more powerfull, and is fun to find one who killed you in past again, and get revenge when he is suposed to be more powerfull and brags about thart fact. Also, there are many different ways to kill your enemies or create distractions... to mention one, you can just stay at distance and shot arows to free jailed beasts, and watch how they eat them all... or also runaway to avoid been eaten too!

No other LOTR game has come close to capturing the grandness that is Middle-Earth. SoM does so perfectly. It's extremely detailed from top to bottom. Although the graphics aren't the best in terms of next-gen, the art direction surely makes up for it. There are also tons of collectibles that have their own back story which you can read (and/or listen to) in the lore menu which is pretty cool #2 Voice acting. Troy Baker gives a great performance as Talion. He gives Talion a bad-ass vibe while at the same time, is able to draw  sympathy from players. My personal favorite performances are Alastair Duncan as The Wraith or Calabrimbor, Phil Lamarr as Ratbag and Liam O'Brien as Gollum. #3 Combat. Combat here is excellent. It's basically a carbon copy of the combat from Rocksteady Arhkham series only 10x more violent which is definitely not a bad thing. You have one button to strike, one to counter, one to dodge and one to stun. The more you strike enemies, the more you fill up your combo meter and once the meter reaches a certain level, you can unleash a brutal combat finisher to change the flow of battle. The stronger Talion becomes, the more combos you can unlock by completing various story missions or side quests. The stealth is a little clunky but it's sufficient enough for players to use it from time to time and you may need to use it early on because it gets rather challenging if you're fighting dozens or orcs at the same time. Finally #5 the Nemesis System. This is a unique system which I found myself being addicted to. The Nemesis system is basically a hierarchy of  Sauron's army of infinite orcs. This is what separates SoM from other open-world action games. When an orc captain kills you, he instantly gets promoted and becomes stronger. This will also happen if even a no name/ no ranking orc kills you, that orc will INSTANTLY become a captain with his own gang. Each captain has his own list of strengths and weaknesses and if they have more of the former and less of the latter, you're gonna have a tough time especially with captains who are virtually invincible to all of your attacks. This gives substantial meaning to your deaths and you always feel like you're getting more experience even in death. But it's not all kill or be killed. As you progress, you unlock more things to with orcs if you defeat them. For example, I \"branded\" one orc captain and commanded him to become a bodyguard for a warchief. After I confronted the warchief, I commanded that captain to betray him and literally stab him in the back. This didn't bode well for the warchief because as it turned out one of his weaknesses was \"fear of betrayal\" which gave the upper hand. Not only that but events can still happen with or without your presence. Like say two captains fight each other for a spot as Elite Captain or one captain plans an ambush against another to take his place. This can all without your character ever being there. It's things like these that make SoM feel more dynamic and alive and I hope that this Nemesis System can be applied for future open-world action titles."], ["stratagemmedley", "User", "8", "Shadow of Mordor is a hybrid between a sandbox and Arkham-style brawler that is set in the famous land of Mordor, in which you play as Talion, a ranger from the black gate who is brought back from the dead, after having his family slaughtered in front of him, by a wraith who had forgotten his past (I would just outright say who he is but I don't want to spoil, even if it is completely obvious who he is)."], ["felasi", "User", "8", "I was hesitant about buying this game, but it turned out to be really good.

So far, all the artifacts have told me more about the people then the history of the region, the factions, and the major players.

I can methodically take out all his unit, so it's just the two of us.  Or I could be in a battle, and one would show up.  I think, I can handle this, no problem.  I start fighting, and then, next think I know 2 or more captains show up.  I've had this happen both in and out of strongholds.

I saw a new LOTR game with decent ratings, had some extra money to spend, and bought it on a whim.  I was very disappointed by the fact that the entire game takes place in Mordor.

I can finally play a LOTR game and go visit all those fond locations!  nope.  The environment is about what you would expect.  It's not that it looks bad, its just that it becomes very dull, very fast.  Everything looks the same after 10 minutes of play.  Everything plays the same within 10 minutes as well.  There's just no cohesion.  I feel as if I'm running around in circles, from one quest marker to the next (enough with the quest marker formula already).  It doesn't feel like I`m getting anywhere.  I would say that open world is not my thing, except that TESO games are some of my absolute favorites, so that argument doesn`t stand.

Oh cool, I stealth killed an orc, too bad theres 50 more in every direction I look.  Just takes away from the impact of putting the effort in to stay in stealth, which by the way, you pretty much are forced to do when running anywhere.

The only \"superboss\" you really get to fight are the Hammer of Sauron, while both the Tower and the Black Hand are ridiculously easy, like just a matter of pressing the right buttons at the right time or sneaking up behind 'em and drain them. Also i hate that you can't jump when you're climbing if there isn't any ledge or platform that you can leap towards, like in Assassin's Creed, you can jump anywhere even if it means you will die or loose a lot of health.

The story is well done for an action game and it does an excellent job utilizing the material provided by the books to give us more background on the setting, herbs, characters, history etc. One of my few gripes is the lack of a loot system which I feel could have been easily added to the game even with the rune system(which I loved) already in place. Being able to customize Talion's armor and weapons rather than being limited to different skins would have been the icing on the cake for me.

I really didn't feel it could do the books or films any justice, but I was hugely myopic in my assumptions.  This game truly is a work of art in nearly every way.  The attention to detail-such as the voice acting (the orcs are amazing!), the collectibles, the weapons, the graphics, etc. are all some of the very best I have ever experienced.

Highly recommended."], ["BBoondocks", "User", "10", "To me, Middle-earth: Shadow Of Mordor is the game of the year for 2014. Set in a fantasy world, made famous by the Lord Of The Rings books/movies, it is a combat orianted open world, action-adventure game where you control a hero, named Tallion, who was murdered along with his family, but got brought back from the afterlife by a mysterious elf, whose ghost powers give you incredible strength. It takes some great ideas from other video game classics, like the Batman Arkham series or the Assassin's Creed, but it's also original enough, with some awesome ideas, to make it a classic on it's own as well. One of these ideas is the Nemesis System, which basically allows you to play the game as YOU want it. You can choose to hunt down and massacre all the orc captains and warchiefs or you can brand them and create your own orc army. The story is also very cool, a revenge story with some fun, flamboyant characters, who help the generally dark story to be interesting enough to play through. The main focus is on fighting, Tallion is a master of brutalizing enemies with his sword, his dagger and with his bow. You can upgrade your moves as you progress, by the end making Tallion a close to unbeatable warrior. Killing warchiefs is not always easy though, as some of them are combat masters with very few weaknesses (these weaknesses you can find out by gaining intel from other orcs and then use that info to kill them - some are scared of fire, monsters, betrayal, etc and by realizing them you can execute them easier). It is also a sandbox game, so you can go around the world freely, whether on foot or by riding beasts, and choose side missions or main story missions in any order you wish. There are also plenty of things to collect and challenges to complete. As I mentioned before, the fighting is very similar to the Batman Arkham games, except it is a LOT more violent. The finishing moves and the executions are always satisfying and you can also use the environment to help you kill your opponents. You can also use stealth to mix things up or destroy orcs with caragors. The free running is a lot like we got used to in the Assassin's Creed series, it is smooth and easy, and Tallion can not die by falling, thanks to his elf powers.

We could leave it that but I'm not that type of person so first off is the story: For me it's the weakest part, I'm no giant fan of Lord of the Rings so I have only a simple idea of whats going on which is you are Talion a man who is part of band of other soldiers called hunters who are the first defense against the Sauron's return, however a siege on the gates takes place and you are captured and killed making you an undead unable to live or die, now it's up to you and your Wraith companion to seek vengeance. So simply put it's a vengeance story and it doesn't (seem) to greatly impact anything of the over-arching story so you would probably come here only for gameplay. The gameplay is a bit of a touchy subject, it's like Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkham , you stealth around finding ways to slice an enemy and combat is your simple attack and counter attack, simple right? WRONG! The combat at least is super difficult creating situations of intense focus as it punishes you for any wrong move you do. That being said it's a good thing creating something of a Dark Souls feel where you have to quickly assess a situation and execute a plan, in the first hours of the game it's pretty difficult as your entirely weak and helpless using intelligence and the environment to your advantage against the most unrelenting Uruks. Which I should mention is probably the greatest reason on this games success: normal Uruks are nothing special except they do seem to have intelligent AI that know that ganging up on you is the best way to kill you, but it's the captains that take the cake as each one of them has a unique name and personality that constantly evolve as they level up making combat more intense if one joins in. They also serve as a vital role within game as the nemesis system works against you and is always in motion, for instance captains will try to complete their own challenges in order to level up and become that much more powerful making you want to intervene and instead you level up, which is another thing: leveling up does make you stronger however it becomes that more clear that it still wont stop the local population to pave the road in your blood as a simple 1 v 5 can turn into a much more **** of what is going on!?

However, like all, every game had its cons too. First, I know it fits nicely with the game and became original with nemesis system, but the majority of its gameplay is just borrowed content with assasin's creed and arkham series. Its like the poor mans version of both of the mentioned games. Next con. Is it mediocre plot and main character. I dont care about him nor did i care about both of them and the plot is so cliche that i find myself more interested to the lore in the collectibles than in the game. Next is its BAD BOSS BATTLE, and when i mean BAD, ITS THE WORST. No memorable boss fight, the most badass character of tolkien chronicles (sauron) did just a cameo in the final battle. damn, they should be embarassed they even bother putting garbage in the final fight. Lastly and worst for me is that THE WHOLE MAIN STORY IS JUST A FREAKING TUTORIAL. You only get the most interesting part of its game in the middle of the second half of the story and there'll be little to no content to experiment and enjoy that gameplay.

I like a lot about this game, which is why I'm so let down by many aspects of this game. To begin, I love the new fortress system where you can capturing and then defend them. Building your army in a area to then bring them to take a fortress is amazing! It's so rewarding to see your effort pay off. Every time you dominate or kill an enemy captain in a fortress assault makes the hours building your army worth it. Even more satisfying, is when you make your way through the fortress and into the overlords room. It is the best feeling when you get that killing blow and take the fortress for you and your army. However, after the first three time it can get very repetitive. This can be due to how many times you need to do this (especially in Act IV: Shadow Wars). The amount of times must do this to complete the game is ridiculous. It is enjoyable when it naturally occurs but act IV outstays its welcome and leaves a sour taste in your mouth. The combat is also has positives and negatives. When you are facing three or four orcs it is smooth and fun but when you are facing large groups (like in the fortresses) it begins to show it flaws. Many times I was wanted to vault over a normal orc but Talion decided to jump over an olog just to have it throw me to the ground every time. This type of thing happened to often and completely ruined to flow of the combat. Even when I tired to use of finisher on a captain the game would use it on a grunt orc and waste it. The story is around 20 hours (not including shadow wars) and is okay. There are some cool things but nothing that sticks out to me and nothing I will remember in years to come. I also noticed that many of the orcs look and often have very similar names. This happened few and far between in the first game and it seems to happen even more often here. The amount of times I have seen an almost identical captain is insane and makes it an inferior system compared to the original game. The loot crates may be to blame for this because of how easy you can unlock captains. You can buy crates and get 100+ captains easy so the orcs will begin to look very similar. It may sound like I completely dislike this game but I don't. The story, mixed with the random events, plus the fortresses made for a fun 20ish hours. After you complete the third act, the game wares out its welcome and becomes very repetitive. I'm fine with some repetitive tacks but when the game is only repetitive, without the story to distract me, it get bored. This is a game that is good but was held back by a lot of small issues.

I played for about 20-30 hours before I started noticing SIMILAR (NOT THE SAME) NPCs huge depth of their characters makes you feel their uniqueness within the world, and even when I pass by regular orcs I just feel obliged to rid the world from this monsters because I feel I truly fight the dark powers and really make a difference by killing them! This is the first game ever that makes me feel that way about any regular monsters that are scattered throughout the world. The danger of any orc being able to slay you and earn the respect and promotion makes you feel cautious of your every move. The variety of the surrounding area is just stunning! every single location is the size of the whole map from the first game which is pretty impressive, considering the amount of action that is packed within. Scattered artifacts and hidden memories now MAKE SENSE! I feel the desire to find out what has happen to the world and  once again I feel like I really can make the difference by submerging into the atmosphere of battle between light and dark. Skills are designed to make you think about the upgrades you should use approaching any significant battle be it an assault, ambush or anything else that leads to the weakening of the Saurons army. It will take me another review to discuss the battle system. Such a variety of moves that Talion and the orcs display just stuns me every single time I engage in mortal battle for survival. Slo-mo is absolutely incredible and is always more than appropriate! I have not experienced anything like it in any game (maybe Witcher 3is coming close to that but not quite). Animation of the characters (main and regular farming material) makes me feel like those scum is actually may be an individual with a personality. The promoted orcs are just fabulous. I can't stop admiring the quality of detail and depth of the characters. I am still amazed with the orcs chit chat right before the mo fos are about to go down. Within the battle there can be numerous moments when the tide can change and the fight balance can shift either way. Several times I was unexpectedly saved by soldiers popping out of nowhere giving me a chance to survive. Just as many times I was about to slay another green beef cake as suddenly I was tackled by some giant in an ambush attempt. The variety of approaches you can take is just mind boggling to me. Loot system is not excellent but is an improvement still. Now there is at least a reason for you to \"farm\" the orc, although coming back to a variety of the enemies, it does not feel completely like farming, since I feel every enemy is unique and worth my time slaying the bastard. And I think the last but not least, the graphics. Stunning. The level of detail is exceptional, colors are beautiful and the textures and attention to the world is awesome! Finally, microtransactions. If you are one of those people who complete the game on easy difficulty, keep buying the chests. For those who are broke and can't afford it - beat it. You don't have to buy it. It doesn't affect you if someone buys a loot box, so wtf would you complain about someone playing the game with a little help? it's their own story! I would understand if it was an MMO and you were busted by jerks who buy 100 boxes and farm you every time."], ["inverguy", "User", "0", "The golden age of gaming is behind us.

When 2 orcs have a fight in the pit the AI is so stupid that most of the time the units just stands there and dies. And you have to lvl up, and the only thing you can do is buying more lootboxes. So when you have paid 60 euro game, you have to add at least 20 more euro to finish the game. It is like they are taking a piss in your face when you are halfway in the game.

You can also use in-game currency to buy the low end loot boxes. I played this game for a week which equates to about 40 hours of game play and got to level 60. I did the daily quests and earned enough online currency to buy the two starter loot boxes (Act 1 and Act 2) about 1300 coins. I received over 20 orcs, 8 xp boosts, and a handful of in game currency boosts. I used my XP boosts while I was playing the numerous main and side quests. Doing this I was able to skyrocket to level 60 and never feel like I was grinding, sometimes gaining two or three levels at once. Be careful though because they only last for two hours of real time, so make sure you use that time wisely.

I'm one trophy away from beating the game while platinuming it on PS4 and have not spent a cent on the game. If today's gaming community is foolish enough to buy them then I can't blame the developers for putting them in. With that said,  Shadow of War is one of the most frustrating experiences I've had in a while. I had such high hopes going into to it after absolutely loving the first one (getting a platinum trophy on the regular and GOTY edition). Parts of SoW are really good, almost 9/10 good, but these parts are surrounded by a couple dozen hours of what is essentially frustrating time killer missions. There are far too many collectables, far too many missions for each faction, and the end-game fortress capture is horrible. I can't believe that when this game was playtested (and it's polished enough that I know it was well playtested) no one said \"doing the same type of mission four times isn't fun, how about making fewer, but more memorable missions.\" If you're doing Gondor missions, be prepared to untie lots of soldiers, if you're doing Carnan missions be prepared to destroy lots of necromancer totems, and so on and so on. Without spoiling why, I'll just say that the final chapter of the game requires to defend your forts over and over again, each fort multiple times. This mechanic goes from amazing to beyond annoying so quickly. I found myself tired of it before the final act. The controls still need work, and this is unacceptable. The studio straight lifted the controls from Assassins' Creed, so they really only needed to fine tune AC's wonky controls. Instead, we're still left with controls that will have you climbing up walls when you don't want to, not climbing up walls when you want to, draining an orc off screen rather than the broken captain, and more. The worst part of all this is that buried in the middle of this tedious borefest is a great game. Some really fun, memorable missions are hidden in here. The new features such as pit fights and fort attacks are really fun at first too. It's only with an insane amount of repetition that they become aggravating. If you go into this game with a completionist mentality you're going to have a bad time. If you go into it thinking you'll just hit up the main story quest then it would be a really fun game.

While I did this it did seems like maybe there would be an intense grind in a few areas that seemed like I just wasn't strong enough. However, once I got back onto the primary quest line it leads me back into the area that I hadn't concerned that was more level appropriate and not grindy at all. If you are too aggressive and Kill the captains on the quests instead of recruiting you could easily turn it into a nasty grind. For those  who only want to kill captains and not play the game as intended this could be seen as a Pay-to-Win, but you just need to use the Free in game currency to repopulate the dead captains. Even the Legendary Loot boxes are possible if you complete the Online Revenge quests to get the higher tier currency for FREE. You could also allow yourself to be killed to quickly repopulate if you find yourself low on currency, but I've not had this problem."], ["Baluberda", "User", "0", "Micropayments, waste 10+ hours grinding or pay real money.

The nemesis system has been refined and the interactions with the orcs are one of the best things about the game. One thing that disappointed me was the story. The orcs in the game had far more of a personality than any humans that you would run into. The Balrog fight is disappointing as well because all I was doing was dodging his attacks and shooting him in his gigantic weak spot. It felt as though someone was holding my hand throughout the fight. Some of the fights with the orcs in the game were way harder than that. The sieges in the game were amazing to watch though. The main parts of the siege are not focused on surviving but making sure that the captains you brought with you don't die. The fights with the overlords were quite difficult and it would occasionally take me several tries to defeat them. Unlike Shadow of Mordor, the ending to this game is really cool. I did not go through with the countless siege defenses to finish the game and I may edit my review after that but the boss fights are not quick time events, the story takes a major twist, and the story somewhat fits in with the movies. Taking all this into consideration, the nemesis system is probably the best thing in the game. The story is bland up to the end but that doesn't make it a bad game. It does a good job of wrapping up the story of Talion and Celebrimbor. One thing that I want to know from the other reviews for the game is \"why do you harbor such a deep hatred for the game?\" I ask this because all I am seeing are people bashing the microtransactions. I do admit that I do not like them either but it does not break the game. I understand some of the reviews with like 4s and 5s saying that the story is boring or something else was wrong.

I loved Power Rangers when I was younger, and played the Super Nintendo beat 'em ups that this game is attempting to emulate into the ground.  This doesn't even qualify as a fan game.  The reason?  A fan wouldn't let this sloppy mess see the light of day.  I can get over the cartoonish design, and I love that they included so many of the (human) characters from the first two seasons, thanks to a 'bundle pack' that makes me wonder if they plan on selling them later as DLC. However, it's all down hill from there. First off, this game looks and sounds like a flash game.  I wish I were exaggerating.  It's also pretty difficult.  Not in a rewarding, feel good way, either.  It's difficult because it's full of bugs, the hit boxes are dodgy, and it's oh so unforgiving when you die.  A death could, and most often will, send you back fifteen minutes.  Most games might be able to get away with this, but this one has a knack for tedious meat bag enemies that take too long to kill.  Not because they're difficult, but because they have too much life.  Play with a second, third, or fourth player you say?  Sure, I'd love to! That would surely make it easier.  The problem with that is that there is no online multiplayer.  Even if there were, I should be able to easily trounce any beat 'em up like this with a single player. There is no excuse for this difficulty.  I have thousands of hours on Monster Hunter (all versions combined), so I'm no stranger to difficult games.  There just is no reason for this kind of punishment in a beat 'em up. No reward worth the risk of being set back fifteen to twenty minutes because you didn't see the Alpha 5 message telling you how to do a thing.  A thing that you're supposed to know how to do in order to proceed or kill a certain type of enemy.  There is a bug that holds you in place after a combo until you let go of the analog stick.  I tried it with the d-pad, and the same results were obtained.  Another similar bug allows you to control the character, but you find yourself against an invisible wall, only able to walk up or down.  Luckily, this is often only a few seconds, but you can die from it easily.  Both of these bugs are common in my experience, the later being somewhat less so, with the former being a constant problem. Then there is the experience system.  I was so excited when I saw they had implemented an RPG like system of leveling up, complete with a skill tree.  It was painfully apparent that it would give grinding a whole new meaning.  Early in games with a leveling feature, you expect to get the first few level ups in a very short amount of time.  In this game, on the other hand, it is a chore.  You get two or three orbs from each enemy that go to your experience bar, no numbers, just a bar, and it moves incredibly slow.  I played through the first area of level one three times, and the second and third once each, saving the experience as I went. This netted me about two-thirds of what I needed for a single level up.   The boss at the end of the first level then pushed it up the rest of the way, with none left over for the following level.  This tells me that grinding is pointless unless you're topping off after only beating a boss, as any extra experience gained when leveling up is forfeit.  At that rate, rather than having experience be a thing at all, they could have just given you skill points for beating levels. I love that they made this game, but I hate that they put no work in to testing it.  I realize that making games is hard work, and the people that made this did an amazing job with what they had.  It's obvious to me that the people pulling the strings rushed this out to catch the Power Rangers Movie hype train, and nothing more.  Think of the most tedious beat 'em up you've ever played.  Now bump it out of the way, because this is going to take its spot."], ["Lukestrn", "User", "0", "Complete garbage. This game was so bad.

The debut of Season 2, reuniting or meeting some of the characters I loved in Season 1. Just like in the first season, this kick starts with an interesting (though a bit dull story wise) way to show off some of the new mechanic this brand new season has to offer, and showing just what Jesse has been up to these past few years. I think what this starting episode did better than the starting episode of season 1 was make me very attached to this new antagonist. I have seen very little of this new antagonist, but what I've seen of him so far has given me some (hopefully) accurate first impressions; scary, hungry, and ruthless while at the same time seemed to really left something to be desired with Jesse, the main character. In terms of some of the other newer characters, they do seem interesting and were just enough to grab my attention, however a lot of them came in as soon as most of the older main characters were wiped off at the very beginning which makes me wonder that they only did that to inflict our interest to the new characters. For instance, this one particular new character who was introduced at the very beginning right before having the swansong of the original characters from season 1 for the remainder of the episode. It also seemed that this new character (with the name, Radar) has known Jesse for quite a while now, otherwise (depending on the players choice) you would barely trust them as much as Jesse did or as much as the older characters. Not to say that I hate these new characters, in fact most of them I really liked, I'm just saying that their introduction could've been a little better and less dull unlike the introduction to the original characters from the first episode of season 1. And as well as the main antagonist which I mentioned earlier, there is another antagonist we got to meet though a completely different category of character compared to the main antagonist. The main antagonist is very wicked, ruthless, snide and horrendous all at the same time while the other is sordid, roguish, nasty and a little austere. I had fairly mixed feelings on this semi-antagonist with me being convinced that she had a pretty indifferent personality, and being a cringe worthy characters in both a good and bad way. A good way because of how much I felt attached to this antagonist when first meeting them based off their nasty personality though in a bad way because of the very short time we had to know them and during the end of their time in the episode made my original opinions of her want to change due to them unexpectedly undoing one of their previous 'villainy' actions which was most of the reason why I came to really hate this person and begin to like her as a semi-antagonist. One of the other new characters we got introduced were a former explorer, adventurer and vigilante named Jack. As soon as he was introduced, he immediately became my favourite newly introduced character of season 2. There was very little I disliked about this guy; he was very intelligent, wise, and brave and cunning once you convince him on taking part of your next adventure, similar to when you convince Soren from Episode 3 to go with you who I also liked when I first met him, though in the next episode I got a new bad impression of him. I certainly do not want this to also happen to Jack in the next episode, but for now, I cannot wait to hopefully see him in action again as well as one of the old characters who was briefly shown at the very end."]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "iPhone/iPad", "PC", "Xbox 360", "Xbox One"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/68b015e3acdf8ffe37bd6f648f53be03.jpg"}

I praised the episode for its new characters as well as the re-introduction of some older characters, the new and less dull gameplay mechanics with less button mashing and 'micro-management' unlike the first season, the updated graphics and the intensifying plot establishment though criticised it for its introduction to some of the new characters, the dull storyline walkthrough at the start as well as the slow and somewhat boring plot during the first half before the action really kicked in during the second half. The ending of the previous episode really left me in anticipation and speculation to what was to be offered next into this new saga with the new main antagonist though really wished for a bit more action in the storyline. While the introduction to this new story during the last episode could've been a bit better and less shallow, this new episode continues right at the orientation of Jesse's new threat from the powerful foe; the admin. While a slight plothole was to be noted in contrast to the ending of the first episode, this opening was not to be disappointed by. Jesse and the entire town is in stake where he/she is put to the test in 'defeating' this foe. With featuring both a lot of action and quick strategy, this already put myself if a great and all interested anticipation for what the rest of this episodes narrative has to offer based off its very promising aim for this new stories climax and the 'sizzling start'. The first bit of action may have occurred very quickly with a somewhat abrupt ending, but it was awesome to know that the action packed part of the story was not really to end there though in fact be reinstated. The admin (the brand new main antagonist) only returns in a brand new physique and even though has the same desire, it feels as if he has a slightly different personality from the 'giant colossus' admin puppet figure to which I both missed and felt contempt to all at the same time. This new yet the same antagonist sets Jesse and his friends out on a quest to which leads them to a bunch of deadly yet bizarre tests to prove their worthy of 'greatness' and save the world from being frozen in time with a mass chaos of the night time consequences. During the episode, we got to regroup with some of the characters we previously met or saw during the previous episode including one of the main characters from the first season who made there reappearance at almost the perfect and most satisfying moment when Jesse and their town is in danger and once again becomes a great asset to your team. One of the newer main characters introduced in the previous episode; adventurer Jack also proves to be a good asset to your team at times including the beginning, while other times where he isn't very useful, but fortunately managed to stay in character. Lukas however was noticed to be acting a bit differently to how he did when we all loved him (preferably) from the first season. A lot of times he is seen acting very astute and far-sighted which isn't very impactful to the story itself though it somewhat limits the expectations from that particular characters personality in contrast to past episodes. As well as this, throughout the episode, we are reunited with the series semi-antagonist we met in the first episode, Jesse's 'rival' to which I stated had lost her 'villain vibe' when undoing one of her nasty actions. I was predicting that in this episode that her and Jesse would be forced to make some sort of alliance with each other. I was wrong. It was seen that she is very selfish and haughty to almost every single character including her pet (to which I expected to become the series' companion). Even in some of the most dangerous situations, this semi-antagonist really proves herself in this episode as not only a fixated villain, but the first traitor we have ever seen in this entire franchise. During the end of the episode, just like the end of the previous episode where the interesting action starts to kick in, this ending ties in even more so with the superior and plot engaging twist. One of the newer characters (originally a friend of Jack) reveals themselves as the true form of the admin and sends away the remaining main characters away to which is to become the main setting for the next episode. This thrilling and compelling ending has left me even more eager than ever to see what is to come next. This episode has not only improved the series with its story driven engagement, but with some of its tie in decisions. Some of the decisions you will make in this episode may have the same or similar initial outcome to the story, but actually changes the meta of your story and the way your story will link to the primary outcome and the two different alternative endings. With these new improvements to the tailored story, the future episodes is looking pretty promising so far and I cannot wait for what is to come."], ["Rhino_Gaming38", "User", "9", "This new episode of Minecraft Story Mode Season 2 proved itself as a very promising one filled with action, plot twists, challenges and more impactful 'story changing' decisions unlike the last episode. Most of the new characters we met in the previous episode make their own unique return as their true self, with one saving the main character from death, and the other being just as nasty as previously, and then we can't forget the llama. The ending showed the series first major plot twist since the Wither Strom saga from the first season, ending off with great anticipation for the next episode. This saga without a doubt, is shaping up to be even better than the Wither Storm saga, though I just wish it didn't start off as dull from the last episode.

Hopefully Telltale can pick things up for the remaining episodes and do justice to Jessie\u2019s journey."], ["InducedRhino438", "User", "8", "Minecraft Story Mode: Season 2 Episode 3 delivers yet another thrilling and engaging storyline along with some action packed themes and impactful story changing decisions different to what we got in Episode 2 along with some dark themed dynamics tailored towards the story. I was exceptionally impressed with Episode 2 with its fast paced action and gameplay and not to mention the plot twist at the end, leaving me in one of the biggest cliff-hangers in this entire franchise. Fortunately Episode 3 does an amazing job at continuing from all of the drama and continuing right where the end of the previous episode left Jesse and his friends and I am not disappointed by it. The writing done to this plot really works and really pays off. Our friend Jesse is sent to a deep, hidden underground prison/reformatory (hence the title of this episode; 'Jailhouse Block') after angering the mentally deranged admin for apparently not showing him as his 'champion' in the previous episode. We are once again reunited with most of the characters featured in the last episode (including the admin during the middle of the episode). The great thing about this is that the first character we are reunited with is determined out of the two characters (Jack or Petra) that was selected during the end of the last episode while deciding on who would go for the clock being the main goal of the episodes plot. This means that depending on who you selected, the beginning of this new episode will be slightly different, though no matter who it is, you will be introduced with an awesome, action packed intro featuring some point and click gameplay just like in Episode 3 of the first season. As well as that, we also get to see a couple of new characters in this episode such as the quirky Warden. We are even reintroduced with a couple of other characters previously seen such as Jesse's friend and assistant Radar, and Nurm the Villager. In the last episode, I had noticed a favourable bond between Jesse and Radar who I had also grown a bond too. During the beginning of this episode however, he is the victim of the episode first major decision which the Warden uses him to influence you into working for him or resisting. During my two play throughs of this episode in choosing both options, I noticed that some of these have very little change to the story while the others have a more impactful change to the storyline. One of these choices made near the end of the episode ends up being not only once of the hardest decisions to make in this entire series, but once of the most heartbreaking. Of course since this episode is set in a dreadful prison, the plot follows Jesse and his friends trying to escape, where they discover that there is one particular prisoner who is the only one who knows the escape route. Referred to as 'Prisoner X', Jesse and his friends must find a way to get to her heavily fortified and guarded cell deep in the prison. based off the choice you made from deciding to work for the Warden or refuse, you will depend on your experience to how you will get yourself to the bottom floor known as the 'Zombie Mines' consisting of all the poor and disgusting prisoners forced to kill and eat zombies. If you decide to work for the Warden, you will promote yourself to working in the room, while if you refuse to, you will find a way to deliberately get yourself into trouble. Once Jesse encounters Prisoner X, Jesse is forced to leave behind one of the series companions; Nurm the Villager and Jacks best frined, or Lluna the Llama the series new animal companion. This choice was both hard and sad to decide because although we hadn't seen these characters that much, what we had seen were strong. Speaking of Stella, we get to see her again where this time she works as an associate and of course has the same bitter & ruthless attitude towards Jesse along with her 'rival' vibe. Some point in the episode, we have the option to let her join us from reasoning with her. if you choose this, than she promises to 'have your back' hopefully in a future episode. And yet again in this episode we are introduced to another cliff hanger though this time it starts during the beginning of the second half of the episode where the admin makes an appearance at the prison bringing back your friend that you chose to retrieve the clock in the previous episode where he tries to force the two of you to fight. After a failed attempt at striking the admin himself, he takes his evil tactics beyond all measures by manipulating Jesse's identity and threatening Beacontown and his older friends. And yet this was all happening when Jesse still has a prison to escape, and once he had, the ending lead to a second cliff hanger!"]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "iPhone/iPad", "PC", "Xbox One"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/98w-game.jpg"}

This game, is so significantly better that the original that I was lost for words. It like they elegantly streamlined everything good about the original game, and added a few cool things to an already perfect moveset! I really love everything to do with the new movement system and was surprised to see it better tuned still after the version from the beta! And the combat, while much more simplistic and generally incredibly easy, especially once you get all the upgrades, was much better by virtue of you being an mostly skip it, and have no gunplay options anymore, because Faith is a much more capable fighter now so when you do fight, you hard and quick and move on. And moving on is what I was often most excited to do. The environments were really quite interesting, and obviously beautiful, and to be able to have so many hidden goodies tucked away in the, and to have so much freedom in the traversal of said areas was sublime. I won't say the game is perfect by any means, as it still has odd bugs while loading on the fly while you were running around what parts of glass you were actually able to explore. I must say, the map is much smaller that it seemed upon first glance, and that's not necessarily a bad thing as traversing all of it on foot makes it feel significantly larger! Also, I had expected that the underground had more too it, so it was disappointing that it was so small. And furthermore, the music was just not terribly impactful. It was functional, but nowhere near as good as the first game. I get that they were going for a sort of ore procedural mix that adapted to play different loops at different times and fade in and out layers of sound, but it just didn't capture me at all like the first game's music did. I guess I'm glad the jukebox is in the Zephyr transit hub then. X3 Anyways, the story, for me, was good. Nothing astounding and so called the personal family twist upon capture of someone who upon first glance was clearly not who they appeared to me. Anyways, I'm so satisfied, cause there is so much more depth and universe building in this story, that unlike the first where I could never imagine a direct sequel to spawn from, I can easily see a sequel being made to follow this game! There are so many interesting possibilities, and I loved and am still loving digging around for more recordings and documents, and listening in on newscasts and loudspeaker announcements to try and glean more about Glass and Cascadia, and Omnistat as well. I can easily see other games moving into other nearby regions while also possibly digging further into Glass itself. In summation, I feel like Catalyst is Mirror's Edge in all ways, and a successful and poignant example of what a good reboot can do to give a franchise a large dose of life and potential it never had before.

I was hoping this to be a really fine tuned of the original Mirrors Edge dated back on the 7th generation of gaming. I still play it on my pc  from time to time because it was a fun experience. This game however feels tarnish with repetitive side quest that generates as much AC2 on their first time showcasing their side quest mechanics. The game is a bore to play and very predictable on its story but still enjoyable. Whats new about this game compared to the original is that the game is a \"open-World\" sandbox game. Reasons why I used quotations is because the game just seems more like a half-baked experiment rather than a complete world that has lively NPC, multiple pathways to venture towards to, and sublime scenery. I'm actually more pissed off that the game isn't linear because the story sure hell is; and in those moments playing the game, it feels better at home but it's sad that there is only so few of those moments. The gameplay is the only saving grace and it's mostly good with the exception of the AI being total idiots. This time, the developers took out the mechanic where you can disarm a hostile from their firearm and use it against them, making it an excuse to use the mediocure combat but if including during the free running, it makes the combat actually a bit more enjoyable. But with the horrid AI,  the game lacks any depth and challenge as all you have to do it stun them with a hard attack and three hits with the normal attack to really just end the fight. The game is a huge disappointment with its lack of any depth mechanics, story, characters, and any other that makes the game stick out more. I'd say wait for a huge price drop like 20 or under. It's a nice game to try but to buy more than 20 is absurd."], ["Futurix0", "User", "8", "I decided to wait a while and got this game 33% off and I can say that I really have enjoyed this game. I absolutely love the futuristic look of this game (I just like futuristic stuff in general) and I'm one of those weird people who enjoy finding pointless collectables and races with different skins (i mean there's 3 different mission types that basically all are just a race). So yeah if you're not into these then the game may be a bit empty. First time when i played through the levels I thought they were long and super interesting but playing them the second and third time they are actually very short and quite simple (but that's just the first time charm i guess) so the levels aren't really something to buy for either. But the thing that I like the most is the open-world map. It actually is larger than I expected (I did have a bit low standards in the beginning, but still it's quite huge) and very detailed. The different districts are visually very different and gameplay vise every place feels unique! (I mean the places are build around running, jumping, sliding, wallrunning and using the grappling hook with some mixes of them all and still none of the places feel repetitive). Also in my opinion the parkour is even better in this game than the first one. I'm surprised that some people may say that \"you just end up going back and forth the same routes\" because in my opinion that's completely wrong. I mean there is a lot of places where you keep going back and fourth like bridges and the main hub but everything else is very open and free to explore. The rooftops do have so many different ways to go, some quicker than other. (Like still today I even find new collectables in small ways and places I've never visited or went through.) Also about the races and other missions(/different skinned races) are very strict and I love that! Of course it doesn't make sense when the delivery is ruined when you're five fricking centimeters away from the guy but that hard difficulty is something I want from a game. So all in all I understand if you think the games seems boring but for me, I love playing my own music (or listening to the great soundtrack) and just running around the rooftops.

The original Mirror's Edge in my opinion was rough in a few spots, but I admired it for giving the player a streamlined experience that focused on being entertaining rather than trying to be the biggest and the best, and this entire aspect was completely reversed with Mirror's Edge: Catalyst. For whatever reason, Mirror's Edge Catalyst is actually an open-world game, which adds nothing to the experience save repetitive sidequests. Not one sidequest in this game stands out in my memory. Compare any of these sidequests with those of more developed open-world games. The Witcher 3's and Horizon: Zero Dawn's sidequests may not be extremely varied in terms of gameplay, but all of them remain interesting because of their engrossing stories. Final Fantasy XV may have had mediocre sidequests in general, but at least it made a few that felt substantial and taught the player something legitimately important about the game. Breath of the Wild had sidequests that were often boring, with a few exceptions, the most prominent one being From the Ground Up. However, the game more than makes up for the lackluster sidequests with the addition of Shrine Quests, each of which provides unique puzzles and encounters. The Elder Scroll's series's sidequests are often the reason to play the game. So many open world games provide useful and interesting optional content, but Mirror's Edge Catalyst uses an unnecessary volume of sidequests as a checklist to give the player. There is so little of the simple fun the original Mirror's Edge had that its sequel can't help but feel watered down. The best moments of the original in my opinion came from the concentration it took to speed through these streamlined levels. The addition of an open world and more open-ended levels in Mirror's Edge: Catalyst detracts from the experience of moving efficiently and fluently through a level because the game openly discourages you from doing such a thing by giving out constant distractions and alternate activities like they're going out of style. The combat also detracts from that experience because the consistently locks Faith in a room with twenty enemies who she takes out within a minute by pressing one button on the controller. The original game's combat was extremely flawed as well, but locking Faith in a room and forcing her to fight a group of enemies is exactly counter to the strengths of Mirror's Edge. This isn't to say there aren't high points. At certain times Catalyst manages to deliver moments which stand up to the original, for example the free-running, still feels fluid and natural, and does a good job making movement more interesting than it would have been otherwise. By no means was the original Mirror's Edge a flawless game either. I'd have a hard time saying that for me it should be given anything higher than a 6 out of 10, but Mirror's Edge: Catalyst is such a misunderstanding of what made the original great that I can't help but feel disappointed.

Keeping your speed up now builds a \u2018momentum meter\u2019 that, as well as allowing you to dodge bullets, also makes your attacks more powerful.

Each sports game has its issues.

MLB 14: the Show does not cut corners either visually or in content. The Show has always been the best looking sports game franchise, and this year is no different. The Show improves on already stunning visuals on the PS3 version and the graphics can be so lifelike, if you look about 10 ft. away from the TV, nine times out of ten, you would think you're watching a live MLB broadcast.

New stadiums are beautiful. Player animations are nearly flawless as they have been for years in the MLB The Show series. Another new feature that I have found very useful is the advanced counts (which is optional). This allows each at bat to begin with an advanced count such as 2-1 or 3-2. This allows a full nine inning game to be played in less than half the time of classic gameplay. The advanced count feature is perfect for those who enjoy playing through full 162 game seasons. One improvement that I hope to see in future iterations would be better accuracy on some of the player faces.

In my opinion as far as gameplay goes it is easily the most realistic of all the MLB the show games. One thing that really stands out to me as to why the game has such a realistic gameplay is the hitting aspect. In past MLB games most people just used X to swing regular and maybe square to power swing with a big power hitter. In this version they have came up with three different approaches to hitting, regular, power, and contact swing. Being able to choose and execute use these three really makes it feel like real life situations and having more control where you hit the ball regardless to the pitch location. The other realist difference maker is the drag bunting. As I'm an advocate for some small ball being played in previous games the drag bunt wasn't very realistic. It was almost impossible to successfully execute a drag bunt down the first base line or to the second baseman even with the fastest players in the league. With the new gameplay a lefty can place a drag bunt past the pitcher and towards the second baseman for a base hit which is what the games best bunters do."], ["bulletchan", "User", "8", "Another fantastic rendition of MLB.

For me I am really enjoying the game. The story is very basic and yes the game isn't going to be for everybody, but I really enjoy the going out and hunting monsters then using what I gain from them to craft better gear. Each monster is unique with different attacks and you need to use strategy to figure out how to take the monster out. To give an example, prior to hunting a certain monster you need to track it and gather information about it. Then as you prepare for battle you need to think about things like do I have any pieces of armor that may protect me from the certain types of attack this particular monster uses, do i have enough health potions, does the monster use poison and if so do I have antidotes made, what weapon will I use, do I want to focus on a specific type of damage, if I eat before what stats do I want buffed so I can select the appropriate meal, what side tools do I need such as do I want something that can stun a monster with a flash of light? Is it an area with lots of monsters where I may want a tool to drive off other monsters who may jump into the middle of the fight etc? Do i want to bring traps to make an attempt to capture the monster? You inventory that you take with you is limited space so its best to pack according to the particular hunt. What areas of the monster are weak points and what are they weak to? Is there a way to minimize the monster's special attacks via targeting certain areas of the monster's body or using specific attacks? What about the environment? Are there things that could collapse and catch us in the middle of battle? Is there nearby wildlife that will jump into the fight? Are there nearby plants or animals who if triggered in a fight will create issues? How can I use the environment against the monster? Then assuming I kill the monster and carve it up I take those components and see what I can make in terms of gear for the next monster and the cycle continues. Its incredibly addicting and there is sooo much more to it than just this very brief and vague description. The combat can feel a bit clunky but this is not a game for button mashing. This is a game where you pick your spots, where you observe your opponent and anticipate its moves and then strike when there is an opening to do damage. Almost every fight is a boss fight. Between the crafting, the looting, the gathering, the combat and all the quests its quite a bit of content and works well together. If you are on the fence about this game I'd recommend picking it up. If you do not have a long attention span and want a game you can finish in 30 hours then this is not the game for you. This is a game that requires a commitment to learn (the game only explains the very basics so you will need to go online and watch videos etc to really learn how to be the best with your chosen weapon- it most certainly is not game that will hold your hand but it does a decent job of providing the very basics to get started) and have your character grow with.

Unlike other RPGs, you don't even have a levelling system. Your character becomes strong because of potions, weapon upgrades, strategies, and more. But even those things aren't crucial.

The changes made have clearly been divisive, but come on. It's more than an exaggeration to say that Capcom has watered down or ruined the Monster Hunter experience. I myself like the changes. A lot. People are resistant to change, and that's understandable. The game looks and plays much better than any other Monster Hunter. Not really that much more accessible to newcomers, nice try Capcom. Monsters are astoundingly well designed, and so are the environments. Only time will tell if the end-game is up to snuff, but so far so good.

Other than that, for the people that felt combat was clunky, Dark Souls III was clunky when I first started until I figured out the combat system. There is a reason there is a lot of 9s and 10s, most of those are people that have played the game before. If you're new to the game then you probably should wait more than 24 hours to give the game a fair assessment. There are decision points when to do that powerful combo or when to hold back. The grind of this game is far superior than any other game. The labor matches the reward. The other thing I'm extremely fond of is the idea that I take this weapon and I make decision points I can't take back to progress my gear through a massive tech tree. But the game is also forgiving in that sense, I can always create the first weapon of the tech tree and make new decisions and have a completely different outcome. I think all newcomers to the Monster Hunter genre need to take a step back and fully digest the game instead of making an assessment after 24 to 48 hours, you have a lot of catching up to do. For the veterans that gave this game a 0, also step back from your elitist ways and think about the evolution of gaming. Walking and drinking or eating is a real life thing people can do, why not make that part of the game itself instead of keeping a game in a box that was created over 15 years ago. Also if you haven't made it past HR 8 when you made this assessment you probably should double back on it and fight some of the latter monsters the game has to offer, fights get pretty intense when fighting one monster and another monster appears well above your current gear level. Same thing for scout flies, I like that when I progress up and hunt the monster several times it gets easier with the scout flies, so what if they show you plants and other items, if you think the game is calling you dumb then you need to go to your bathroom mirror and tell yourself that not everything is about you and to stop taking things so personal.

You'll also be able to join a faction. Pretty much everything you do earns points for your faction, and the faction with the most points at the end of a certain amount of time gets big rewards.

Everything is pretty close together but i actually like it that way, like i said their are a ton of side missions/ items so i think having a bigger world would make it nearly impossible to find all of the hidden items and everything.

This games completely legit. It's great for the price first off. The graphics arnt terrible, for ps4 they arnt good though. However the gameplay is good fun little story and I got the platinum too.

It is like a metroidvania arcade game meets Phantasm.  If you even know what Phantasm is go ahead and buy this game. My Night Job is a love letter to 80's horror with subtle nods (such as John Carpenter's The Thing and so many others) that even the biggest horror fan might miss a few. Basically, you are in a big mansion and tasked with saving 100 people while trying to prevent a variety of monsters from destroying the mansion.  It is so much fun for someone who grew up crunching quarters into arcade games like The Simpsons and X-Men back in the day. The game is simple to play, but has quite a lot of depth.  And it is challenging. Not Dark Souls challenging, but no one is going to run through this game the first time they play it. For a game that is under $10 you can't go wrong.  I've probably put 5 hours in so far and I plan to put in at least another 5-10 hours to get as many achievements as I can. My complaints are minimal. Trying to balance killing the bad guys without them destroying the mansion while reaching all the necessary places can be frustrating at times, but that is also what makes the game fun.  A solid 9 out of 10."], ["raccoondaddy", "User", "8", "My Night Job is a sort of a sleeper hit, that most will probably ignore.  It somewhat reminds me of Metroid, but not in the sense of gaining powerups to access other areas, more on just how it plays.
