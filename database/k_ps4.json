Even the gameplay perspective, compared to its predecessors the core gameplay is a definite improvement to an already outstanding formula.  The multiplayer is really cool, nothing that necessarily stands out  and let's be honest, you could get a better multiplayer experience from COD or Battlefield but that doesn't mean K:SF's is bad.  But where the game plummets is in the campaign mode, mainly in horrible level design.  The game immerses you with its visuals but giving you a waypoint or a good inclination on where to go somehow slips its mind.  For the most part, the levels are rather open with multiple paths to take and explore, which normally would be a good thing but Shadow Fall never truly gives you a good sense of where you're going and if you don't go the scripted way you'll fall into a group of enemies and enter a lack luster shooting set piece.  The huge maps almost ruin the gun fights, you never seem to be in the right space to run behind cover to have an epic shootout.  The game briefly does however provide a waypoint but it goes away and you have to press a button to retrieve it again which breaks up the action and tension the game tries to build by constantly having to pause the game for something that should be a given.   In the End:  This game shows what the ps4 is capable of.  It's stunning visuals combined with the core gameplay and amazing use of the touchpad make it a spectacle to behold.

I haven't spent much time with the campaign (played a level or two), but that was never what excited me about the game. If you're looking into it for its single player component you may be disappointed, but it is my favorite online shooter for PS4 so far. The levels are varied, and each one is gorgeous. Of the fps titles available at launch this was the only one designed exclusively for next-gen systems and it shows. The lighting and textures make the game a treat to look at. In terms of gameplay it feels like a fairly typical shooter, but done very well. There is nothing that makes Shadow Fall very unique, but what it does include feels very good. There are several abilities tied to each of the three classes you can play as. Several of these can get annoying at times, especially if you face a whole team of people using them. Each team also has a fixed base on the map where they will spawn unless a teammate has set down a spawn beacon that you can use. The predictability of the spawns means that there is a chance for the opposing team to set up around your base, and once that happens there isn't much you can do. There are automated turrets at each base to prevent them from getting too close, but these only do so much. It's fairly easy to set up outside of their range. Once that's done, the game becomes as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.  This is a bigger issue in the team deathmatch modes where there isn't as much of an incentive to move about the map, but even in the objective based modes there's a chance once team gets the other pinned in their base."], ["Mattyice", "User", "8", "I'm hooked.

Some missions get boring easily, and I really did not want to continue playing the story after 2 hours. However, Shadow Fall's multi-player, like Mercenary's  is very fun and a great experience.

Tools like the Owl, as well as many of the multiplayer perks help keep things interesting, but they fail to use any of these gadgets in a particularly creative way. The singleplayer campaign itself is around 10 hours long on hard at a guess, which is a fair bit longer than your average FPS these days, and the graphics are incredible and the level design is generally very good. Unfortunately, there ain't much re-playability here as there's no co-op, no higher difficulty etc  if your first playthrough was on hard, bar trophy grinding, there really isn't any reason to play through again. The multiplayer is also decent, there's plenty of interesting perks and abilities, but a great number of the weapons are dull and samey, and the multiplayer gameplay despite it's creative intentions just end up being frag matches at certain map choke points. There are bots you can play against, but they're the equivalent of a practice mode in that you can't do any challenges or unlock anything while fighting against them, so they're not really useful to the average antisocial gamer.

Most of the game is B level effort that the developer expects you to play like AAA game. The story is non-sensical, and tries to make you empathize with space Nazis. You just can't empathize with space Nazis. Maybe you will feel bad for the civilians who have to live in the space Nazi side of the planet, but their plight is the fault of the space Nazis. A poor story alone has never ruined an otherwise fun game. Too bad Shadowfail has frustrating, outdated gameplay. Perhaps I was put off by the not 1, not 2, but at least 4 tutorials in the game. Grenades take 10 seconds to throw, and you will be killed by enemy fire before you can throw one. Enemies have X-Ray binocular vision and have no problem shooting a moving target and making cover is almost worthless. The levels themselves are made non-sensical by arbitrary use of fences or piles of rubble. At least 25% of the game is spent looking for the waypoint. One frustrating set of levels uses the same non-sensical logic puzzle. You need to disable sentry devices in the same way. Moving forward, however, has nothing to do with disabling the sentries devices themselves. The same is true of missions where you have to defend a position while you wait for a computer to activate or an aircraft to land. The event only occurs when all enemies are elimited.

For starters, I am not a pro gamer, or someone who has hours and hours to invest into a game to become good at it.

Also sometimes you are not really giving a choice, like the character gets very angry and challenges a guy which is way better than him, while I know that's a bad idea but I can't choose. I would recommend waiting, and buy only once most of the issues are fixed. However, when they are fixed, I think this has the potential to be my favourite game of all time.

I start by saying if you do get a PS4, just get it   with Killzone Shadow Fall. You will probably have more fun with that than you will with this. So to start off; Knack is a action adventure kids game. Knack the character is an 'Orb' that is made of relics. He collects relics to get bigger and increase his health. The beauty of this is to appeal to kids by being a huge destructive machine. But being this comicly large takes away the challage its trying to offer. Normally I would like something like this because sometimes I like things to be easy. Aside that it does try and introduce the adventure part of the game by being open minded about what the character can do. However Knack takes it the wrong way. For example most of the game will revolve around fighting goblins. The goblins and other enemies get bigger as you progress through the game. But Knack gets bigger too so the gameplay never really changes, it only looks like it does. To make things worse the game offers a very strict route that you must take. The gameplay is just so boring, you feel after a while as though each level has been copied and pasted. But its not all bad. For example Knack offers a range of combat techniques. This can be both fun and intresting. But enemies have this advantage of hitting you repetitivly. This causes you die quite frequently. The characters are quite bland too. The scientist has lost his wife in a exploring expedition,  which gets very anti-climactily resolved by her mysteriously coming back. We are supposed to care about her but we don't know anything so we can't really care. In short Knack is a predictable adventure game for next gen.

Switching from cut scene to gameplay is really smooth. I really liked Knack as a character he was pretty good unlike pretty much everyone else. It didn't do anything terrible just not good enough. I'd say it's too simple for it's own good honestly. You don't have very many options when approaching situations since you only have 1 combo. I feel like if there was just more to it it would be fantastic and the game screams that there should be more but there just isn't. The story isn't all that great and the dialog is pretty crap honestly. I'd really like to see sequel honestly. There needs to be a lot of improvements though especially in the combat.

This is NOT like those in ANY way, besides the cartoony visuals, which, admittedly, look good. I'll start by saying this: this game is best for kids and video game newcomers. Whereas the aforementioned games allowed for several fun styles of gameplay, Knack relies on but one, which it hammers into the ground. Not only is it painfully linear, but the combat is rediculously repetitive, never deviating from the same triple strike combo, Sonic the Hedgehog-like homing attack knock back move, and iffy dodge maneuver, and if you're only interested in looking at pretty scenery while smashing stuff, I've not said anything to turn you off. The issue is that this overly simplistic style of gameplay doesn't jibe with the game's intentions concerning the story. Put simply, the story tries. If that sounds too broad and unspecific, I'll elaborate. What does Knack try to do or be? The answer is, a lot. One minute, the plot is centered around the ongoing feud between the humans and goblins, with titular character Knack flung in the middle as a weapon of the former against the latter. Deeper investigation shows the power struggle dates back to a war that socially and technologically sent the goblins back to the proverbial stone age. Done right, this story could have delved deeper into these developments to tell a compelling tale that blurred the lines between right and wrong. But as soon as that begins to flesh out, the plot switches up, focusing instead on the wealthy and politically powerful main antagonist bent on using Knack as a key to a mysterious door, then using the main characters to unknowingly lead him to it when that proves as fruitless, for the purpose of revolutionizing the world with the technology he will find behind said door. Until about 75% into the story, the protagonists and the antagonists are generally hostile and work against each other for no apparent reason, because again, the story isn't written very well. Through all this, there are mini conflicts, such as Knack being little more than a tool, making few decisions on his own (yet trying to have some personality as a character), the Doctor(who apparently has no name)'s assistant struggling to be listened to, and the Doctor's thought a to a be a late beloved working for the enemy. None of the plot elements, large or small, are ever explored well, and very few go well with a gameplay style that is purely centered around running forward, gradually getting bigger, and smashing things. On top of that, the dialogue is quite bland. In short, this game tries to be simple and deep at the same time, overdoing one, and failing miserably at the other. Still, there's nothing mechanically wrong with the game, and Knack's gradual increase in size from a runt to a titan is satisfying. So if you can look past the tons of wasted potential this game had, by all means, pick it up."], ["NoRecourse", "User", "9", "Fun platformer. Not overly difficult for young players.

Almost every facet of the game is near the level of quality of modern gaming but lack the certain polish of the next generation. It seems that every good aspect of Knack is balanced with a flaw. Visually, the game can be quite impressive: the myriad of little pieces that come together to form Knack, the cartoony character design of the main characters, the quite paced action of fighting and platforming; however, the game also lacks severely in several visual aspects: the terrible rending and detail of objects (made especially obvious when shown in cutscenes); the plain, uninspired, cookie-cutter enemies; the moments of lag and random cutscenes to show Knack jump down from a lenge which bring the game to halts. The story, too, is a bit of a mess. Cerny described the game of being of Pixar/Disney quality, but the story is cliche and quite boring in fact. Many possible conflicts are resolved in seconds; for example, Knack gets blown up and destroyed by several of the antagonists at many points in the game, causing tension and questions of what is to happen next, just to have him reform seconds later. The contrasting aspects of Knack become apparent also during gameplay. Knack's moves are very simple and intuitive  his true power comes from his growth and size; however, the game makes you feel so powerful and so weak simultaneously by allowing you to grow to gargantuan sizes but having enemies still do a ton of damage per landed hit. Dodging is really your only defense which, lucky, is made quick and easily by the use of the right analog stick; there is more variety in the game place by the unlocking of equipment parts throughout the game, but unfortunately they will come to almost no use unless you place through a second time because most of the special equipment parts are only finish by the final few chapters in the game. Along with pieces of relics, Knack can grow larger with pieces of wood, ice, etc. These pieces add a bit of defense for Knack; however, they are underused and their uses for solving puzzles are obvious. Knack overall is a game lacking polish, and it is not Cerny Games  they have made several great titles. It is obvious that the game was under extreme time constraints. The story is mediocre, the graphics are bad for last gen, and the combat is lacking. But it is the most unique retail game launching for the PS4; if you like difficulty and action platformers, pick this one up.

It's simplistic in its concept; you begin each stage as Knack in his base form (small and quite fragile) and as you progress you assimilate artifacts that allow Knack to grow and become more powerful. You can also harness the power of \"Sun Stones\" collected throughout the game to unleash special attacks every so often. Naturally, this makes stages easier as you go along instead of becoming progressively more difficult. Traditionally games go from Easy >> Hard, but in Knack you end each stage as a towering behemoth capable of crushing any enemy with absurd ease. Ironic, because in the earlier portions of each level Knack is small and easily defeated. My biggest gripe is that it's impossible to tell how powerful an enemy is until it's too late. You can get body slammed by a giant ogre and take minimal damage, but get speared by a flaming arrow and be instantly destroyed.

Controls in game make it hard to hit enemies in pressured battles, and the dodge mechanic is more of a death sentence than a helpful move. I thought Knack was going to make me feel like a kid again.

If I'm lucky, Knack survives three hints from enemies, but with health regeneration being basically non-existent (once in a while, it tops you up, but most of the time collecting health gives say 5% health back, if you're lucky!). Knack's ability to grow bigger and stronger is swiftly negated by the enemies getting bigger and stronger. Which, sure, every game the enemies get harder, but throughout the entirety of this game so far, I have yet to survive more than 3-4 hits in succession, before scattering into a million pieces of disc-snapping frustration.

Whenever I died I never felt like the game cheated me, I understood that it was me who made a mistake and I learned from them. Many games now have a chooseable difficulty system like Knack but few execute it as well as Knack: higher difficulties add harder platforming, enemies learn new moves, and more enemy combinations are used to offer more intriguing fights. The controls are simple but that adds to the challenge of the game. Because you only have a limited set of moves you have to actually strategize when you go into a fight because bum rushing in will quickly have you killed. The story is simple but that is understandable since this game is geared to be kid friendly so the developers couldn't throw in too many deep, serious underlying messages or make the characters too complex. The characters although simple have a fair amount of charm, you won't be falling head over heels for them but you won't hate them. The characters all look good and so does the environment, but the levels seem a little static in some areas otherwise the graphics are all charming and good.  Adding to the replayability of the game are collectibles you can find in hidden areas (some of these areas are very, very obvious while others will take a trained eye to see). These collectibles are either parts for devices that will help you on the harder difficulties or crystal relics that will unlock alternate Knacks for new game +(s). You won't unlock many (if any) of these on your first playthrough and looking for the rarer items can be a pain, however you can also choose any collectible found by people on your friends list making it simpler to find what you want. Overall Knack is a good throwback to the days of \"Nintendo hard\" games with simple yet fun gameplay that will challenge your skills and has plenty of replayability.

THE MOST UNFAIRLY REVIEWED GAME I'VE EVER SEEN! First off this is a typical Japan Studios game in the same ilk and quality as Puppeteer and Gravity Rush. Visually the game is beautiful with rich colors, shiny textures, and great particle effects, Knack looks good and absolutely shows off the robust powers of the PS4. Knack controls fluidly in combat and while dodging with a solid framerate and it is in my experience completely glitch free. I typically prefer adult style games, but Knack for me was a breath of fresh air and a nice diversion from the GoW's, GTA's, and MGS's. Compared to the aforementioned games Knack was just less stressful and more endearing while still maintaining a proper difficulty and an entertaining story and though it's been said before it still rings true, \"Knack is like playing through a Pixar movie\". The combat is simple but clean and depending on your size and physical makeup Knack's abilities and powers change accordingly which keeps the action fresh. Throughout the story you will change into a multitude of different versions of Knack such as wood Knack, ice Knack, metal Knack and more and each iteration of Knack has their own perks such as wood Knack being able to catch fire bringing down a reign of flames and burning embers on your enemies. During the game you will find hidden chests with \"loot\" in them, this loot consists of mainly gadget parts used to create gadgets that slow down time, increase damage as your combo gets higher, find hidden areas and much more. The loot also consists of crystals and if you acquire the requisite amount (10-20) you can turn into a different looking knack with different abilities i.e. Sunstone Knack has stronger super moves, brittle Knack has a powerful melee attack, Vampire Knack, Diamond Knack ect. If you have people on your friends list who have also played Knack and have previously opened the chest that you just opened it allows you to take the item you find or choose one of the items any of your friends found at that same chest. This intuitive loot/friend system helps you achieve your desired knack/gadget and adds incredible replay value and fun. You can also play Knack in co-op or local co-op which is alot of fun. When you break it down Knack doesn't do a whole lot to innovate or surprise, but as a whole it is a light, fun, and well executed game with tight controls, polished graphics, and an addictive loot well thought out loot system. For some reason in the industry it became the \"cool\" thing to bash Knack, even i bad mouthed the game and was reluctant to buy it and only bought it with the intentions to return it within a week and get my money back, but after seeing how great the game was i kept it and still own it with the intention of platinuming it.

Unless you're playing on easy mode, this game is far more difficult than you'd initially expect, even as early in as the first levels enemies can one hit kill you, and the sluggish moving Knack seems to only want to indulge them, at first it might seem bearable, but in later levels where enemies are shooting projectiles left, right and centre it becomes a real pain, and regardless of how monstrously huge Knack grows from consuming relics, he still seems to drop faster and harder than a paper airplane. The story itself is nothing special, it basically escalates from a series of random and unconnected events that eventually become a story, despite that the main bad guy basically exudes evilness from the get go, making it quite predictable. The game is extremely linear, thus removing any, if not all replay value, which only makes getting all the items from the chests a pointless and annoying grind. The graphics are fine, no real fault with them, but as they're quite cartoony it was a bad choice of game to show off the PS4's 'amazing' graphics capabilities. The games only redeeming quality in my opinion is that you can share the pain and boredom with someone else; it has a co-op mode. I use the term 'co-op mode' loosely as it's more like one play with an annoying second person who'll sometimes help you, sometimes knock you over leaving you at the mercy of a thousand enemy arrows, or sometimes go off screen and scream at you for ditching them because of course the camera only follows player 1.

Firstly, anyone who thinks Knack is a kids game is very much mistaken because, even though it's cartoon style and initial visual appearance may not attract everyone, it is certainly a game that can be played and thoroughly enjoyed by many. I took a risk when I bought Knack and had heard some bad reviews yet I was pleasantly surprised by the simple, yet enjoyable storyline and the initial first chapters where you fight through hordes of goblins. But that's probably the limit of its good qualities. The fighting in the game is way too simple: one move. Or three if you count the dash and jump attacks but they are all very similar where you punch each enemy countless times just to move on to the next part of the chapter where you, once again, punch your enemies to move on. It's just way too repetitive, and the boss battles are a complete let down, essentially they're just bigger versions of normal enemies with more health and have the ability to run away to a different part of the map once you punch them a few times. It was fun in parts but also incredibly frustrating in others, the checkpoints in Knack are horrendous and if you die, you will have to grind through the same parts as you did a few minutes ago just to get back to where you were, also the camera angles in some parts of the game are awful, causing you to misjudge an enemies attack or fall off a ledge. Despite all of this though, there was still something that drew me back to the game, it was incredibly enjoyable oddly enough and the storyline was something that surprised me the most. The developers entwined three groups of enemies, Viktor's robots, the goblins and, towards the end of the game, some kind of ancient creatures. The cut scenes were short and not very plentiful but they managed to tell the story and the backgrounds of the characters very well. Furthermore, they explained why you were doing what you were doing and the purpose of your mission. The end boss battle was, unusual. I won't spoil it but it wasn't what I expected to be doing at the end of this game. After the final boss battle the cut scenes that followed wrapped up the game nicely and left me feeling satisfied without any unanswered questions. As far as re-playability goes, I have yet to decide. The only thing that kept me continuing through the endless waves of enemies and repetitive fighting was the storyline and now that I know it, I doubt I'll enjoy it enough to finish a second play through. The only extras in the game are collectibles, which are parts to build gadgets to help you or even unlock new Knacks such as diamond Knack or dark Knack, these add an interesting twist to the game but still don't really contribute much to the main game. In conclusion, this game was very fun and good to play as a casual game or 'cool down' game however it might not be for everyone so I would recommend either getting it cheap on a sale or borrowing it from a friend first to see if it's for you.

The game play mechanics were good although they can get repetitive. i recommend playing the demo first before buying, as the 40$ price tag is pretty hefty for a game like this.

Feels like someone's graduation project at school, except it has zero new ideas. It's a fighting game, reduced to kick and punch and dashes and jumps... no combos to learn, no depth to the gameplay. Online is just random matchmaking, and basically just a stage select screen, a character select screen, and the 'brawls'."], ["Untitled94", "User", "7", "Surprisingly fun to play. I mean yeah, it's just another Smash Bros clone with a different skin on it and is not quite as good, but it was better than I was expecting. You don't even have to like Kung Fu Panda to get some sort of enjoyment out of this game (It would help though). Not worth full price, but it is a little fun to play if you get a chance to play it."]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "3DS", "PC", "PlayStation 3", "Wii U", "Xbox 360", "Xbox One"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/e6141d9d6b3246dc8121ef3a7777e96c.jpg"}
