Soon after playing you notice the game provides no HUD or out-of-scene visuals, cues, notifications (other than saving). it doesn't hold you hand, provide you with numbers to obsess over. There's no inventory, no crates or barrels to loot. No gear to gawk over, none of that. This game ventures off in a bold new direction. The vision and bravery of this small team to conceive of an experience (I don't even call it a game) so profound, thrilling, confusing and contemplative as this, is just remarkable.

I've been gaming since 1985 and gaming in recent years has become very stale. That is until British developers Ninja Theory gave us HellBlade: Senua's Sacrifice. This is made by a team of just 16 people yet has AAA productions for a price of just \u00a324.99. The graphics are pretty amazing, especially the character models, lighting, reflections and atmosphere. Some things like rocks and trees can have low res textures, but it doesn't really take anything away from how well polished this game is. The atmosphere of the game is a thing of beauty and really sucks and draws you into it. This is also helped by the impressive sound quality and voice acting. Gameplay wise it is pretty basic and is a mix of solving puzzles and sword play. The sword play is fun and fluid even if easily mastered. The puzzles take me back to games of the early 90's when games were harder. Finding and lining up symbols to unlock gates can sometimes be a bit of a chore but the game does let you know when you're on the right track, as it gives off cool red symbols that appear and float about all over the screen to let you know you are close. Not so when having to repair something like a staircase though. You have to figure that out by yourself and while i personally like it i can see some people getting frustrated by it and finding it hard. But if you have been around gaming since the 80's and 90's when games were harder you will more than likely enjoy this aspect of the game compared to all the modern dumbed down games of today. There is that sense of challenge and achievement when completing a puzzle which allows you to move forward in the game. There's no rushing through here. Other puzzles include remembering short paths to escape and the highlight for me is the alternative world puzzles. You walk through certain markers or look through certain objects and they will open up routes you couldn't previously see. Some of these are very subtle like a new route will appear that wasn't there before, or a bridge appearing, wall vanishing opening up a new path to complete a puzzle. Or the entire world scenery will change from dark blue, glum and rainy to bright and sunny as you have to keep switching back between the two to progress through a level and solve puzzles as some routes will only appear when it is dark, rainy and glum and others will only appear when it is sunny. The story is pretty good but what makes it interesting is Senua's mental health problems. She suffers psychosis and hallucinations so you're never quite sure what is real and what isn't. You hear the voices in her head which either encourage her, go against her, or guide her. They can be quite harrowing but can also be quite humorous. The voices in her head made me feel genuinely sorry for her and for the people out there that suffer this horrific mental health problem. But it also made me root for her and i desperately wanted to do right by Senua and guide her down the right paths. And as much as i enjoyed playing such a dark game i got great pleasure when seeing Senua experiencing something joyful like a joyful hallucination that put her in a good place and showed off the innocence of her character, the real her. She is a great character and will go down as one of the most memorable characters in a video game. This is a brilliant game and just \u00a324.99.

When I concede the point, I am not speaking of 'graphics' -- much too small a word to convey the various immersive elements Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice excels at.  This effort is beautifully photo-realistic and lovingly rendered with art direction that is at once daunting and aloof, allowing the player to share in Senua's sense of penetrating a foreign and hostile hellscape, but it is also intricate and personal, as Senua reacts and flinches, balks and lunges at her own personal demons given form in another culture's landscape and mythology before her.  But, those are just the visual elements.  The sound design is perhaps some of the best I have ever played through.  Unlike so many games, the music is not so omnipresent that it becomes a character unto itself competing with the one I am controlling, rather it is utterly organic to the experience Senua is having.  It so flawlessly punctuates the game play that I only noticed how well it was carrying me emotions when I had to mute my TV to answer a call.  The mind-expanding surround of Senua's psychotic voices so mimic psychosis in the real world that there is a psychiatric caution preceding the game, similar to those that other games have for epilepsy patients.  If you suffer psychosis, this game might be too 'real' for you.  And, that is brought to bear with technical mastery in the sound mixing of this game.  The principal character's psychotic voices speak from all directions, to her, to themselves, to each other, even to you.  I turned on subtitles to get some distance from it myself, not that I was about to think any of Senua's voices in her head were my own, but just to be sure. You can insert a nervous laugh here, and if you were playing, you'd be hearing one as it circled behind you.  Yes, this game is art.  But, one does not play art.  This is also a game.  And, unfortunately, it is in game mechanics that I had to start deducting points from what would otherwise be a 10.  The game is brief all-told.  Playing it, you will guide Senua through a series of environments in which she does the same several exploration puzzle-solving maneuvers over and over. You will face several Vikings and have combats that look great, owing to beautifully realized motion-capture.  Then you will fight a boss with a pattern of attack you must memorize in order to counter it in a few specific ways.  The duration and complexity of each of these puzzle areas, and the duration and complexity of each boss's attack sequence will increase, otherwise you'll be doing the same several things through only enough different environments that you can feel the repetition begin to weigh on the game.  And, then it will end, having given you less than 24 total hours diversion, less than 12 if you're good, about 6 if you're great. The artistry of the game should not be minimized, and the game is worth the retail price just to experience it, but set your expectations to that level.  You will be playing interactive art, more than you will be playing a game, and it will only take as long as visiting a good museum."], ["tenow", "User", "1", "Face-cap technology, pretentious story, very slow running and no game mechanics is all you need for AAA indie title.

Can't believe it is considered as a review."], ["rckstrdave", "User", "5", "Let's have a thoughtful review about the new Hitman, instead of pure fanboy love, or full on GamerHate.  Hitman has some serious problems.  It gets a few things right, but is that enough to make up for its sometimes monumental, game-killing failings?  So, what did they get right?  The expansive and detailed sandbox level design (at least in the one real level that comes with the intro pack) is excellent.  Lots of options on your approach and execution of targets (not mention actual targets this time around!).  Similar to older Hitman titles, there is an interesting but vague story that is wisely kept in the background.  Contracts Mode is back, which was the best part about Hitman: Absolution.  Improved movement and melee combat options (though 47 is still a little stiff, not to mention reliant on quicktime events rather than good mechanics and hit detection).  The  guns feel good.  It's certainly the best looking Hitman game so far.  Some basic fixes are a welcome change:  having a map, the ability to close doors, AI that doesn't turn paranoid just because you have the same outfit.  In a lot of ways, the new Hitman is a solid improvement over Absolution.  However, the developers really dropped the ball in a few areas.  The biggest problem is optimization; the underlying structure of the game is disturbingly bad, like seeing a new mansion being built on a flimsy old cinderblock foundation.  Load screens are really, really long, and even though there is only one real level to load so far, you must completely reload the entire level each time you load your previous saved game.  Even just pressing pause and sifting through menus creates surprisingly long loads.  This is a killer for a game built around experimentation and stealth--one wrong move, or an experiment that doesn't pan out so well, and you'll be forced to load your game.  If you know that's a two minute ordeal, it actually encourages you not to experiment, just because it means staring at a load screen instead of playing.  There are some framerate issues as well, but this is a minor complaint compared to the load screens, which is pretty much a game killer.  The online nature of the game is the next biggest issue.  Though you can play offline, a significant amount of very important features are disabled, like detailed reports, challenges, Contracts Mode, and unlockables.  However, I haven't been able to complete a mission while online yet, as I seem to lose connection within 3-8 minutes of logging on.  The game launched to server issues, par for the course these days, and I'm writing this during the first week of release, so one would assume they will fix these issues.  However, the real problem is that a lost server connection boots you from your game.  Which means another really long load screen and lost progress.   Which all seems completely unnecessary.  There is no need for constant connectivity, as there are no other players in your world; when you finish a level, you could just as easily upload the raw data results of your playthrough with a very brief connection.  I finished the first mission offline, but missed out on all the in game rewards because of the connectivity issues.  What a huge disappointment, and some serious face-palming over the game design.  However, the biggest problem with Hitman is the release strategy.  It boils down to: release a shell of a game, with very limited content and serious structural problems, for full price, with the promise of fixing/adding to it over the next 1-2 years (Destiny, anyone?).  This forces anyone who buys the game during the first year to pay full price to do beta testing.  Assuming the company actually fixes the game during that time, those who buy in at year 2 will usually get to pay a discounted price for a finished game.  This allows developers to get games to market quicker and sell them at full price for longer, but it basically screws their loyal fans--like me.  The previous Hitman games all had issues, but by the same token, all have been highly polished, completed games.  This new Hitman title is neither polished nor completed.  I paid my $60 out of loyalty to the series, but I'm feeling a bit cheated so far.  Calling a game like Hitman \"Episodic\" is not quite honest.  It's just unfinished. And that really sucks. The developers have set themselves up for a very tricky gambit.  Will they actually fix this game?  Will the promised content be good?  Will they reduce the load screens so I can actually experiment in this cool sandbox they built?  If they succeed, then at best, their loyal fans are bitter over their tactics.  If they fail, they've alienated the fanbase of a hugely successful IP.  Maybe in six months, Hitman will get better reviews? I hope so, as I'd still like to play it.  At this point, it is a mostly unplayable beta.  I hope the increased sales are worth it for the publishers, but it seems very short sighted and damaging to the brand to sell half broken, unfinished games."], ["RandomLetters27", "User", "10", "Hitman games have no equal.

The war was started because the U.S defaulted on billions of dollars of debt owed to North Korea.  The U.S economy collapses giving North Korea the perfect opportunity to invade.  Like Far Cry, Homefront places you in an open world (in this case Philadelphia) with districts to liberate from North Korean control.  Yellow and Red zones are what you start in, and once you liberate certain districts you will be able to see stash spots or vehicle spots on the map.  Kind of like when you take a tower in Far Cry and it opens up the map so you can see what exactly is in the area.  It is a basic style of game play but believe it or not, it has it's moments.  Being a huge fan of Dark Souls and other really hard games  I was a bit surprised at how difficult this game is.  This is a guerrilla warfare type of game which basically means you are out numbered and out gunned so hit and run tactics are your best friend.  This isn't like most fps where you can take several hits before dying or taking several hits and hide so your health regenerates.  It only takes 3 or 4 shots to kill you so if you happen to stumble across a 4 man patrol your best strategy is run, or find higher ground and attack with the element of surprise. Although the AI isn't exactly the smartest they can and WILL flank you any way they can so it can get pretty intense.  The guns you can use are super limited which was kind of a let down BUT the customization of each gun can mix things up a bit.  For instance, in the beginning of the game I was given a pistol and a few other gun parts I was able to use to convert my pistol into a SMG.  This is all done simply by pressing up on the d-pad.  That will allow you to see where you can add or subtract attachments from whatever weapon you have equipped, and you can do this on the fly which is nice.  You are probably wondering if what was wrong with the game at launch was fixed, and for the most part I can say it is.  The frame rate is ssssoooooo much better.  Almost to the point where I only saw it drop during a huge firefight with all kinds of bombs going off.  Other that that I haven't noticed anything super obvious.  The patch I had to download after installing the game was almost 10 gigs so I imagine there was a lot fixed, and like I said I finished the game and didn't come across anything other than one or two frame rate dips during intense firefights and some minor AI issues.  If you haven't played Homefront yet it is totally worth $17.00 to $20.00 at gamestop or anywhere you can find it cheaper than PSN.  I think you will be a bit surprised at how fun it CAN be.  Again, this game did not justify the 60 dollar launch price, and I totally agree with most of the lower user scores because this game was totally broken at launch.  That said if you haven't played it and can afford 20 bucks go ahead and try it out.  I had a lot of fun with it."], ["FENIX400", "User", "7", "Pathetic story and no innovation from others open world games. But, the setting is great and the combats are really full of action.

The one behind the bow, our protagonist Aloy, is a character full of magnetizing determination and confidence. And the world she inhabits is gorgeous, dangerous, unique, and immersive. But even with all those pros, there are some cons. Where Horizon Zero Dawn stumbles is in it\u2019s story, settlements, and side quests. Almost every side character is forgettable or dry. I never found myself ever truly compelled by the emotional weight on the side characters shoulders nor did I care. One character I truly did not care for was the lead villain. He is terribly flat and cliche. And his fate is so anti-climatic that it\u2019s laughable. Unfortunately along with the characters that aren\u2019t Aloy, I must also say that the story for the most part was not impressive and neither was it\u2019s conclusion which I found terribly predictable. Then there\u2019s the settlements. The settlements were nice looking but empty. All I ever found to do in the settlements were to accept a side quest or find a merchant selling basically the same thing to me as the previous merchant I found in another location. Speaking of side quests, many consist of \u201cfollow the trail\u201d or fetching an item. These are fun but get awfully repetitive at one point.

It could have used a bit more complexity and fun, as there is very little benefits coming with a new level (only a bit more health and a skill point to spend). WORLD: It's a very large open world that we can enjoy roaming through. There is a lot of gathering happening (could have less). WEAPONS / ARMORS: Don't understand while there is only one model of spear when everything else as several variations and upgrades. It's illogical. While it's mostly traditional weapons, they have a good spin on some of them. I especially the one creating a kind of air blast (tearblast). STORY: Enjoy the overall storyline.

The game is an open-world action RPG done right. It is obvious that the graphics are among of the best of this generation. The game's varying locales make sure that the game's aesthetics never become dull. Great graphics still have the disadvantage of long load times. Make sure you have something to distract yourself with while you're playing this game. Even though the world is large, every place you can go to and activity you can do has a high bar of quality set for it. The world has reason to be exactly as large as it is. I would not suggest going through all the content, but at least finish all four cauldrons, override all five tallnecks, and get blazing sun ranks on all 15 hunting trials. Though there are leveling elements involved, there is a substantial feeling of progress and difficulty (which is best set at normal and never changed). Some of the resource systems feel annoying until you upgrade inventory size. The resources used to make arrows are so common that I never felt like I actually had to think about that system. There are enough unique enemy types to where it feels you have something to sink your teeth into, and you also view them differently as you progress through the game. A robot that gave you some trouble or you avoided at the beginning of the game now feels fairly easy (but not mindlessly so) to take out, and this feels great. Each robot has a complex array of weak points, points weak to certain types of damage, points that you can shoot off to disable some of the robots' attacks, points that you can shoot to make them explode, points that you can shoot off to use against the robots as weapons, points to shoot of to disable a robots shield, points to shoot off to disable invisibility, points that are only exposed by shooting other points, points that the robots only expose on occasion, smaller points that are detachable for some quick loot, and points to shoot loot crates off of the backs of machines among other things. On top of an intelligent AI, there are lots of ways to fight these guys. You can take some time to lay out traps and stock up on health reserves or perhaps override some machines to fight for you. At the same time, you're not too disadvantaged if you just want to get into the action immediately. Human combat, on the other hand, mostly involves shooting people in the head and exploiting AI. It's not awful, but it's pale in comparison. The variety of viable tools you have at your disposal is as wonderfully deep as the robots' design, and somehow the game's mechanics still do not feel bloated. The story is a mixed bag. It starts out very captivating and is enjoyable all the way through, but there is little to no character development or interesting voice acting besides that of the protagonist herself. Only one character besides Aloy (Sylens) felt fleshed out enough for me to feel satisfied. Though the character models look beautiful, the lip syncing is pretty bad. It was by far the most enjoyable when delving into the ruins of past civilization. There you find text logs, audio logs, and holograms that tell a detailed story of humanity's efforts to exist past an apocalypse. Each mission along the main path explains another aspect of this story, and it gives you enough information to satisfy you yet also want to find more. The story only had one part where I really felt emotionally invested, and that was on the second to last mission. The ending is a bit disappointing. Also, for a game that has tons of battles against giant robots, ending the game by fighting an enemy type that has already popped up many times before is underwhelming. The game's ruins show some colossal, ancient war machines that perhaps could have been corrupted by the game's main villain to make for a great final boss."], ["HENCHMAN", "User", "9", "Currently level 42 : Game starts off a bit slow but gets interesting and addictive after.

The game is much more challenging as you are essentially trying to hit moving bullseyes on machines. The concept of shooting cannons off machines is nice as well as overriding machines which you have to work for, not just a gimme. The different machines with different strengths and weaknesses is a nice touch, as well as a variety of ways to take them down. Maybe it's just me, but it's refreshing it's not all about blood and guts.

Most NPCs you meet are boring or weird, not often you come across an interesting side quest for example. I even found myself annoyed by some of the quest givers because of their facial animations and voice. Even the main character is a bit stiff and boring in general.

Fighting robots is an indescribable pleasure, but fighting with people is rather boring and dull. The plot also disheartened.

The combat is basic but very fast and fluid and looks gorgeous throughout with is a feat in itself for a world as open. Easily one of the best looking games out there. Issues for me was the stealth side of the game, hiding or staying hiding was too bad but it's been able to tag and know everything so early on making it far too easy and also just calling guards or machines over one by one with nothing alerting them as bodies stack up. Again making it too easy as it's my main fault is its a stroll in the park really. The story (no spoilers here) is gengaging and enjoyable but the same can't be said for the side quests and errands which is a fault with most open world games in fairness and there's a lack of them for a game and map of its size.

The premise of Horizon Zero Dawn is an excellent one. Throughout the whole 50 hours, I was happy to find new data points to read or listen to. The writers found a way to peak my interest into the backstory that is the past of this world. There are many games were I skip the cutscenes or don't pay full attention during them, but I swear I was actually happy to find myself in a cutscene. You can compare the feeling to the Uncharted cutscenes. As far as the technical goes, I was not able to find any real issues besides frame rate drops during intense battles. But those were few and far between. Animations are incredible, and the world, as I'm sure you already know, is visually stunning.

The game itself is split between indoor and outdoor areas, with the latter being the superior of the two. The lighting in the outdoor areas is stunning, and the excellent work with shadows grounds even the more ridiculous creatures in the forests and grassy plains they're in. In terms of aesthetics, this game is untouched by any in terms of quality except for possibly Uncharted 4. This especially works in favor of this game when it comes to the more basic mechanics like the stealth. Despite it being extremely limited, the grass is the only thing possible to hide in, the visuals stop the mechanics from becoming unforgivable. It's much easier to get sucked into the experience in this game rather than a game with less polished visuals and audio. However, despite the visuals doing their best, the stealth mechanics do get stale eventually. They function virtually identically every time they're introduced, and due to their simple nature, feel inferior to the more open-ended stealth mechanics of games like Metal Gear Solid V. The combat, on the other hand, needs no outstanding visuals to sell itself. Against the robots, this combat system is one of the greatest systems ever made. By giving each weakpoint a functional use, and removing that use with each weakpoint Aloy knocks off, it gives every battle a unique ebb and flow, and when the battle shifts to Aloy's favor, it feels like you're overpowering a giant titan. The human combat is much less impressive, the humans don't take advantage of the game's systems or do anything interesting in terms of attacks or strategy, yet the combat still simple fun in its own right. The worst moments of the combat, are never unforgivable. Walking down a hallway and stopping to shoot a few mindless human enemies may not be technically impressive, but can be fun for the brief periods of time its introduced. Luckily, multiple story missions do use the robots as enemies, leading to many unique moments rarely seen in other games. The Point of the Spear is extremely good at giving the player the freedom to experiment with the game's mechanics on their own, which makes everything the player learns feel organic, and the Mountain that Fell is an outstanding mission because it puts the player in new environments to fight the robots, instead of the regular tight corridors and hallways. The cauldrons, while being an interesting idea, often fall short of being anything special, due to the basic nature of their puzzles. Often in 3D games, and even in extremely recent ones such as Breath of the Wild, the nature of puzzles will be introduced slowly, so the mechanics feel familiar and difficult puzzles never feel overwhelming. Early in Breath of the Wild, the player is taught that freezing gears will result in the platforms they're connected to to stop moving. Later, there's a shrine where the player has to figure out which gear is connected to which platform and when to freeze the platforms to get the chests and still be able to get to the end of the shrine. Similarly, there is a puzzle in Horizon, where the player has to figure out how to get from one platform to another using cogs, yet the puzzle isn't built up much at all, as this is the only time where the game brings up being able to switch the direction of the cogs by hitting the light in the middle. Despite the lackluster puzzles, however, the cauldrons are amazing at creating an atmosphere, and the battles at the end of them are always top notch and outstanding at getting the player to think quickly in tight spaces, so the experience evens out. The side quests all have interesting stories, but they unfortunately fall into the same trap of following the trail of purple on the ground, so in my experience they are quite repetitive to complete one after another. The main story is intriguing, and makes the player always want to experience more, thanks to how well it controls information. For every piece of information revealed, there's a new question asked, always a new mystery to solve. This is almost a downside, however, because the story requires constant attention, doing anything besides following it breaks its pacing. There is very little downtime in the story and therefore the player will either follow the story and not do what they wish, or they will do what they wish, such as explore or do side quests, and it will break the flow of the story and remove the dramatic tension. This never ruined my enjoyment however, and despite its flaws, in my opinion Guerrilla has made an outstanding game, and a must-play for PS4 owners, so I'm going to have to give this game a strong 8 out of 10."], ["aljirik1992", "User", "8", "Horizon: Zero Dawn - \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442... \u041f\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u044f \u0443\u0436 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b, \u0447\u0442\u043e SONY \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a \u041b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \"\u0441\u043a\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0446\u043e\u0432\"! \u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430, \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439, \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440, \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0451\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0443\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b \u044f\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441 \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0443 \u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441 \u041a\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0442, \u0432\u0435\u0434\u044c \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430-\u0442\u043e GG \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0438 \u0430\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0441 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u044e \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0435\u043c\u044b\u043c KillZone \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0443 \"\u0425\u0430\u043b\u0432\u044b\". \u0421\u043c\u0443\u0449\u0430\u043b\u043e \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e, \u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0410 \u041f\u0415\u0420\u0412\u042b\u0419 \u0412\u0417\u0413\u041b\u042f\u0414 \u043b\u043e\u0440 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b! \u0412\u0435\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u0438\u0431\u0435\u0440-\u0431\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c \u043f\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043c \u041c\u0430\u0439\u043a\u043b\u0430 \u0411\u0435\u044f, \u0430 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441 \u043a\u0438\u0431\u0435\u0440-\"\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c\", \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u0432\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043e \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0440. \"\u041c\u043e\u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043c\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u0437 Guerrilla Games \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443?\", - \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u044f \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b \u0436\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438..."], ["Tommaso77", "User", "10", "Horizon Zero Dawn is an ode to single player and open world gaming. The game plays fluently, Aloy is versatile and easy to control, giving you a smooth and enjoyable gameplay. The combat is great, and more importantly it is challenging, fast-paced and in the end satisfactory, with machines that will really make you run and roll for you life like never before. What I feel is the strongest point however, is the story. The first day I saw the trailer at E3 2015, I was immediately interested in discovering the reasons behind the apocalyptic open world that you will explore, and I was not disappointed. The story surprises, shocks and fascinates, keeping you gripped until the epic grand finale. Aloy is of course at the centre of the story, a strong, funny, emotional, and sometimes insolent (to others) character with which you will fall in love with, making you care for her, which is something that not a lot of games manage to do. But it is refreshing to see that all of the side characters that you will meet in your main quest or in side quests, although secondary to Aloy, are well-written and interesting nonetheless. And of course something must be said about the open world. It is gigantic and wonderfully designed, making each region of it beautiful and unique while making you feel little and insignificant to such vastness, but most importantly it is packed with things to do and to discover, making exploration interesting and rewarding. However, even if this review has been a general praise of the game, I must talk about the only problem that I had with this game, and make no mistake it did not ruin my experience at all, but was still annoying. My issue with the game is the day and night cycle. The in-game night is as long as the day and it is really, really dark, and though sometimes fascinating, it makes the combat and exploration a bit more uninteresting and underwhelming. But I repeat it did not ruin the experience as a whole."], ["JPL1936", "User", "10", "A captivating open world with stellar graphics and scenery.

The robot dinosaur are crafted with care and precision to the equivalent of Overwatch's cast of heroes, they are truly that unique and different. It never gets old targeting an enemies weak spot and watching it get detached; no longer able to use that weapon.. but wait it gets better you can even shoot out their weapon and use it on THEM! how mind blowingly amazing is that? The challenge of the game is also just right, 45 hours in, it never gets old just killing the dinosaurs and watching different swarm of enemies hone in on you. Now the story holds its own and is very interesting (cool concept), and most importantly very original. I liked Aloy, and the supporting cast was very well written and acted; different personalities everywhere. The only negatives which didn't impact my enjoyment at all was that some side quests were bland, and a perk that broke the immersion for me (you whistle). The human A.I was questionable, but the machine's A.I was great. Now what I don't understand is why are people bashing this game for it's lack of originality? Yes, it takes aspects from other games, but it refines it to make it original/fun and fresh. For example, I never said \"wow I wished there was more buildings I could scale to uncover more of the map when I first played Assasins Creed\"; but I definately said I wished there were more Tallnecks to scale, more cauldrons to uncover, etc! Bottomline this game is a 10/10 for me, a must buy, a masterpiece, etc. I understand not everyone is going to like this game, but I will leave this statement here to help people out. If you like the reboot of tomb raider (2013, 2015) and/or the witcher 3, then you will like this game...You might not like it as much but even then it would be classified as an great game.. alas there is a higher probability you will like this game more than the previous two.

There are a few graphical things, like people have mentioned of the environment, such as water and grass, not really reacting to your character.

The little pleasures are upgrading weapons and armour, discovering new places and hitting the sweet spot on a machine from a distance (most people will know what I mean). It's also great that the player can go down two different path-styles. Either go full on warrior style of 'I'm charging in here all arrows blazing' or stealthy and sneaky style  'You'll be dead before you know what's hit you'.

The IA of these machines makes combat stimulating and engaging. All of them having different sets of strengths and weaknesses that you can take advantage of with different weapons and equipment that can be upgraded. Thu human enemies on the other hand could have used some work but combat against humans is not the focus of the gameplay so there is little to be affected by here. The controls in Horizon are nothing short of stellar, letting you chain all the movements at you disposal seamlessly, running then sliding in the dirt while taking a shot at a machine's weak point and finishing with a dodge to the nearest shrub to hide from other robots that were just made aware of your presence, all executed with one of the most fluid and responsive controls I've ever experienced outside of a fighting game.

Seems to me these are reviews coming from people who DON'T LIKE OPEN WORLD GAMES. Having played many of these games and loving them I can say that I also love this game as far as I've gotten (I've been playing since I got it on release). If you enjoy vast open world games you will like this game. On top of a wonderful world it has some of the best combat in ANY open world game I've played thus far. Yes it is limited, but thats because this game isn't trying to be as role-playing heavy as something like elder scrolls. The combat is fluid and can be approached in a lot of ways. It also has a simple stealth system that fits smoothly in the game (if you expected this game to have stealth as good as MGS or styx thats just stupid). The story may not be for everyone, but with a badass main character, and well done side characters it is easy to get absorbed in the story. It's true the story doesn't mount up to things like the Witcher 3 (at least thus far) but come on, thats not really a fair comparison to make, cause very few open world games have a story that does (also don't pay attention to those who knock the ENTIRE STORY in a review that was written in less than 6 hours after the release of the game, I haven't finished the game yet, but I enjoy the story now more than I initially did in the first couple hours). All in all this is the best open world game I've played since the Witcher 3, and since then I've played some great games like Fallout 4, Skyrim, MGS5 (loved this game immensely but as far as the open world goes it was a bust), and Final Fantasy XV (not sure I would call this game great but I had a lot of fun with it)."], ["Exquisit", "User", "10", "Aloy is just.......

I can honestly say that there is absolutely nothing I hate or even dislike really about this game.  Horizon Zero Dawn is classified as an open world, action RPG, and on those things it does not disappoint.  You play as Alloy (no not like the metal) a cast out for reasons I won\u2019t say.  Alloy is haunted by questions about the \u201cancient ones\u201d and sets out on a journey to answer questions she has about her past as well as what happened to those that came a thousand years before her.  HZD\u2019s fluid controls and even better combat mechanics make it a joy bringing down giant robotic beasts.  Although quite challenging at times HZD never oversteps its bounds.  What I mean is that the times I did die, it was never something that wasn\u2019t my own fault or stubbornness.  This is something I deeply admire about this game.  It\u2019s not a cakewalk.  It\u2019s not afraid to challenge your every move, and it does it without being a complete troll.  The story was quite fascinating to me, and I found myself really anxious to find out what Alloy finds out next.  Gorilla studios, the developers that brought the Killzone series to the PlayStation, really show what they are capable of and although I never believed Killzone to be bad games, they just never quite clicked for me.  After playing HZD I cant help but admit to the reader how wrong I was about my perspective of Gorilla being a somewhat mid tier developer.  HZD in my humble opinion rockets Gorilla Studios to legendary status.  This game is an instant classic, and although it shows a lot of influence from other games Gorilla has crafted the perfect mesh.  If I had to say one thing I wasn\u2019t super impressed with would be SOME of the side missions.  It seems like they might have tried to go the Witcher 3 route.  Making each side quest a strand of a much larger thread and just as important to the lore as any story mission would. HZD just misses that mark.  I never felt like I was doing tedious filler, but I think there were a couple that I would have loved to see expanded on.  If you own a PlayStation and are a fan of open world RPGs chances are you are playing this game as I write this.

The A.I of the machines is seriously impressive, maybe the most impressive aspect of the game- again, this is the highest quality I have seen so far in video gaming. I would say the game overall feels 70% Witcher 3 and 30% rise of the tomb raider, combining every thing that's great about those games, and nothing that is negative.

The missions are boring and very tedious. Running from point A to B and back again felt like a drag and only seems to exist to artificially extend hours of playtime. The voice acting was bland which is partly due to poor storytelling and partly due to actor's inability to perform well. The open world, though beautiful, is also dry. It lacks one of the most important factors any open world needs, immersion. Outside of killing robot dinosaurs, running boring errands for random people, or picking up pointless collectibles, there's no living in the world. You don't build a home, you don't sleep, you don't interact with people outside of quests, and there's no everyday-like activities taking place that you engage in. There's not much here to justify the game being an open-world in the first place and could've just as easily been a linear game, where Aloy travels from one end of the map to the other on a path to find out about her true identity and purpose.

The game also competently brings down the witcher 3 from its throne and challenges the white witcher in every aspect . Not only is the character Aloy an enjoyable character embodying the mannerism's of the likable hero like if Lara Croft and Nathan Drake had a illegitimate child Aloy is the result, But the fluidity of the combat and the brutality of the weapon work makes every Kill a must share moment . Usually in open world RPG's the slaying looses its finesse within in the first four hours but somehow Horizon Provides enough weapon variants to make the shooting of mechanized monstrosities a sight to behold. Being the killzone guys first excursion players will find familiar aspects that are common place in most open world titles now. Yes climbing a tallneck is a lot like the towers from Assassins creed, Yes clearing out bandit camps is very reminiscent of Far Cry 3 and Yes Dungeons do feel a lot like Destiny  however even with those elements thrown into the pot Horizon still manages to stir enough flavour into this dish to give it some much needed taste. The story is intriguing and as you explode this vast multi-layered world you will enter more Ruins than Tomb Raider .

Because I couldn't imagine honestly rating this game a zero, or even below a 5.  For me, this is the best open-world game since The Witcher 3. And in a lot of ways, it's actually better.  The soundtrack is incredible moody and diverse, while the graphics are truly spectacular.  The first time you encounter a Tallneck in the wild, it's hard not to marvel at its beauty and stature.  Almost every inch of landscape is beautifully detailed, and amazing to look at.  The gameplay itself is mostly typical for an open-world game. It includes side-quests, errands, hunting grounds to play on, and other things to do while you're not engaged in the main story.  The story line itself is interesting, full of lore, and a little confusing, but it really is a small gripe, because all is forgiven every time you engage the mechanical beasts. The combat is where HZD shines.  There are so many ways to approach an encounter, and they're all incredibly rewarding when you succeed.  Fighting the mechanical foes truly never gets old. Every fight is unique, and fun.  Using the main character's scanning device, you can detect different weaknesses on the robots, and check out important items in your vicinity.  Resources you've collected can be used to craft potions and other things you'll need while making your way through the incredibly varied landscapes that are found in the large map.  Aloy, the main protagonist can be upgraded over time too, making her much stronger, but definitely not invincible by any means. HZD truly is an amazing game that was obviously created with immense care and attention to detail.  And unlike a lot of other Triple A, open-world games, it runs very, very smoothly, even at launch.

The main character, Aloy, really makes the game. The combat is exciting and visceral and the visuals are excellent. It has RPG elements, but they are pretty light, all things considered. Normally, I am all for heavier RPG mechanics, but this game isn't at all about weapon damage or statistics, but rather the myriad of strategies you have to employ to take down the varied enemies. There are some flaws, the game can get a little repetitive (but never really boring) and there are some eccentricities which are annoying, such as if you aren't paying attention and run 'out of bounds' it reloads your last save which could have been a while ago, because the save points are scattered about. I don't know if this is a good or bad  thing, but I think I'd have preferred it if you could just save whenever. You also never really get much \"stronger\", as referenced by the RPG-lite mechanics. I have the best weapons in the game and comparing them to the other weapons is just like...\"meh...I could probably do without these\". I feel like end game items should always be powerful enough to make the game a good deal easier, as you usually have to jump through hoops to get them.

The side quests also have no point and aren't worth doing. The main story is good for a video game but the dialogue and voice acting aren't anything special, and a lot of the dialogue is cringe worthy. The game feels more like it was made for young adults and teens instead of adults, so keep that in mind if you are an adult. The characters look like shiny latex dolls. The draw distance on the open world is so bad that the world looks like a fake plastic model a lot of the time when looking into the distance. It seems like they put a lot of resources into making an open world when it would have been a better game if it was more linear and if they had spent more time on adding depth to the game play, combat, melee combat especially, and the dialogue and voice acting. Over all the game would have been much better if they focused more on quality instead of quantity. I like playing through the main story and the combat felt pretty good, even if melee combat is complete crap. The main point of the game is Aloy, her story and journey to discover the mysteries of the past, and fighting the robots. Other than that the rest is needless filler.

I enjoyed hunting animals to make bigger carrying pouches, learning to take down machines, finding loot, crafting and never knowing what might be around the next bend.  Taking down your first big machine is thrilling!  The other thing is there are too many outfits and weapons with different features which could have been combined into one or two.  Don't like having to switch bows all the time - love the different arrows but it would have been better to use them with one bow.  Some weapons are crappy like the slings and rope - never used those much - but the tripcaster is a blast.

As for the side content, it has TONS, which is both good and bad. Some of the side missions are fun and interesting, with dynamic characters, while other missions are clearly in there for padding. As for the gameplay itself, Horizon takes many elements from other popular game franchises, and sort of mashes it all into one. Not necessarily bad, but unfortunately, doing so made the gameplay experience not feel as unique. For instance, it feels like a mix of Far Cry, Assassins Creed, and The Witcher into one game. The robotic dinosaurs felt cool and interesting for sure, but sadly, it wasn't enough to merit a completely unique gameplay experience. On the other hand, the environment in this game was very done. Every small detail and design made the game truly come to life, and of course the amazing graphics blow you away.

Effectivement, il apporte quelques r\u00e9ponses aux questions qu\u2019on aurait pu se poser apr\u00e8s en avoir fini avec la trame principale, mais il reste finalement trop simple et avare en rebondissements et en s\u00e9quences fortes. Et c\u2019est bien l\u00e0 le gros d\u00e9faut de cet add-on qui aurait d\u00fb miser sur son histoire pour passionner les joueurs avant un \u00e9ventuel second \u00e9pisode. Et il n\u2019y parvient clairement pas et pr\u00e9f\u00e8re miser sur d\u2019autres points pour inciter le joueur \u00e0 se replonger dans l\u2019aventure. Sc\u00e9nario o\u00f9 es-tu, o\u00f9 es-tu ? Pour venir \u00e0 bout de \u00ab The Frozen Wilds \u00bb, comptez une douzaine d\u2019heures. Si la qu\u00eate principale ne n\u00e9cessite pas plus de cinq heures de jeu, sachez qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019atteindre le niveau 50 pour r\u00e9aliser la derni\u00e8re mission. Il faut donc \u00eatre r\u00e9aliste : ce DLC ne s\u2019adresse qu\u2019\u00e0 ceux qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 termin\u00e9 l\u2019aventure originale une premi\u00e8re fois et qui oscillent entre le niveau 35 et 40. Son v\u00e9ritable int\u00e9r\u00eat se trouve dans ses \u00e0-c\u00f4t\u00e9s. En plus de la qu\u00eate majeure, de nombreuses missions secondaires (Chiant \u00e0 mourir) viennent s\u2019ajouter pour renforcer la dur\u00e9e de vie et offrir quelques \u00e9l\u00e9ments cl\u00e9s \u00e0 Aloy. On pense notamment aux \u00ab cristaux bleus \u00bb, l\u2019une des grandes nouveaut\u00e9s de ce contenu additionnel, qui permettent de troquer avec des marchands et de s\u2019offrir de nouvelles armures et armes. Notons qu\u2019en plus des traditionnels arcs, on peut mettre la main sur trois nouvelles armes puissantes : Le Souffle de Forge (le feu), le Foudroyeur (la foudre) et le Rail de Glace (la glace, bravo). Il faudra rapidement les ma\u00eetriser afin de venir \u00e0 bout de votre mission. En plus de nous pr\u00e9senter une nouvelle zone de jeu, totalement in\u00e9dite et situ\u00e9e au nord de la carte, \u00ab The Frozen Wilds \u00bb introduit de nouveaux ennemis, domin\u00e9s par un Daemon. Bien plus puissants et durs \u00e0 cuire que ceux que nous avions pu rencontrer jusque-l\u00e0, ils vous donneront certainement du fil \u00e0 retordre. Encore plus que ce fut le cas dans l\u2019aventure principale, il sera bien souvent n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019analyser les situations qui se pr\u00e9senteront avant de passer \u00e0 l\u2019attaque (analyse des forces et faiblesses des ennemis) et de privil\u00e9gier, autant que possible, la discr\u00e9tion. Ce DLC se d\u00e9marque donc par sa difficult\u00e9 parfois tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9e qui ajoute finalement un challenge important et qui joue sur la dur\u00e9e de vie globale du titre. On pense notamment \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re mission qui nous confronte \u00e0 des boss tr\u00e8s puissants et qui pourraient, comme ce fut mon cas, donner l\u2019envie \u00e0 certains de lancer la manette en plein c\u0153ur du t\u00e9l\u00e9viseur.

However, for the cost of the ticket we still strongly recommend the purchase."], ["Brash Games", "Critic", "80", "The lack of an easily definable grid system does mean that Hyper Void feels less precise than some of the more famous examples of the genre, and yes, the inclusion of a story is both strange and largely pointless, but thanks to its fantastic level design, silky smooth 60fps visuals and the brilliant implementation of a power gauge, Hyper Void represents another fine example of the genre, one that can comfortably stand shoulder to shoulder with the likes of Tempest and TxK."], ["Game Rant", "Critic", "80", "Hyper Void is an adrenaline fueled throwback to classic arcade shoot \u2019em ups, with gorgeous graphics that are nearly as beautiful as the gameplay is exciting."], ["We Got This Covered", "Critic", "60", "Hyper Void does enough to stand out as an entertaining shoot-'em-up despite its somewhat frustrating, bare bones presentation."], ["PlayStation LifeStyle", "Critic", "50", "Hyper Void is not without its fair share of fun, producing some eccentric and vibrant experiences with its procedural environments. Unfortunately, it\u2019s still very light on additional content and offers next to no incentive to continue the fight once you\u2019ve exhausted the short run of levels."], ["Siddhartha19", "User", "10", "Mix in Tempest, Ikaruga, and the space giraffe, you get Hyper Void, a game that initially dissapointed me, the first 4 levels or so are very easy, flying through wormholes felt gimmicky, and the controls felt too simple because you only press side to side, but then you fly upside down, and the controls flip, then you want to b*tch about why its so needlessly hard lol it takes time to get used to it.... There are 29 levels to this game, eventually the game gets tough, Dark Souls tough, all types of obstacles will be thrown your way, most will be scared off, the controls are funky (in a good way, it just takes a bit of time) it wasn't till I passed 10 levels or so that I felt comfortable with the controls, but even then they are always throwing new stuff at you, at some points it feels like your traversing a 3d ikaruga... I have only passed 20 levels, spent 15 hrs getting there, so for 10$ its a pretty good deal, slowly but surely I have been enjoying the game more and more. I have noticed that every time I pass a new level I'm making huge jumps in the leaderboards, so I know i'm not the only one thinking its tough! lol If your into shmup type games this is a must buy, these games require concentration, so most people should play something like this! lol But I know the difficulty could scare them, so if your up to it its only 10$."], ["Agret", "User", "5", "The game looks and sounds like someones first Unity project. The game constantly reminds you that it was made by one guy, as a first game it is playable but it is certainly nothing noteworthy. The game is missing the frantic difficulty of other arcade shooters and just feels very bland and unrewarding to play. Some money spent on a better soundtrack and some expanded use of particle effects would certainly go a long way, I found the presentation of the levels to be poor at times not knowing where the edge of the playfield was, in most shooters of this style they put a border along the edge to help you judge the boundaries.  This game is a one man loveletter to Space Giraffe but lacks the charm. If you have an X360/PS3 grab Space Giraffe instead."], ["Nel", "User", "5", "Extremely clunky hard to control space shooter. Very basic game with graphics that can make you feel very confused, and the difficulty is very high. The game has about 30 levels."]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox One"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/32082df7be9604c3bc6479c30e03a990.jpg"}
