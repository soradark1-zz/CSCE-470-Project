This game was a masterfully crafted perfect storm of old melded with new. It stayed surprisingly faithful to the original in terms of a large volume of the stage layouts, but switched up enough details to keep things interesting, both in gameplay and story. The plot has been updated to be more complex than the original, and switches up during the last act in a way that, while probably predictable for someone fresh, would throw off anyone who thinks they know how it will end just because they played the OG R&C. One drawback I can think of is the  bloated cast, inflated by the presence of the, for the most part, somewhat unnecessary Galactic Rangers. They never really do anything besides keep the player company during stages, and this alone takes away from the \"Ratchet & Clank vs. the Galaxy\" feeling that was captured so well in the original and subsequent titles like Going Commando and Tools of Destruction. However, that is just a personal complaint, though it, along with the restructuring of the plot, can be attributed to why the game doesn't have as many locations as the original, and therefore is not as long. While this game does not reach the same peak of the series that A Crack in Time did, it is a more than welcome return to form for the franchise, and makes me eagerly await more in the future.

Believe me I wanted to like this game but, there are just so many things wrong. The biggest problem with this game is the blatant lack of content. I took my time with this game, really trying to milk it and it was still only about 5 hours long. A lot of the content I expected that they would reuse from the original was strangely absent, like a lot of the planets that I loved (like Eudora, the logging planet, that planets was cool and great atmosphere). The new story additions are stupid, too (but that's just my opinion). The whole Galactic Rangers thing kinda seems like a ploy just to sell **** (I will get more into this later). There are only 14 weapons in this game, which is even less than the original! Beyond that, the weapons are shallow, half of them are just from the ps3 games, like the predator launcher or the groovitron. The Drek from the original R&C was intimidating and throughout the game you wanted to stop him, however in this he is a joke. He looks like a cartoon character and his new voice actor doesnt fit the role of a super villain. He is literally just a ploy to introduce Dr. Nefarius into the series, as Nefarius just kills him anyway. The whole mood of the game feels super cartoon-y, which is the complete opposite of the original and of what I expected. What made the original so great imo was how gritty and unpolished it was, as well as how each planet had its own atmosphere, while in the reboot each planet feels the same and the game drones on after the third or fourth planet. Seeing this short, super polished, easily beaten game makes me think that I was literally watching a movie and pushing buttons. However game play and mechanics arent the only things wrong with this game. The game runs in 30fps, which tbh looks kinda bad but it was a design choice, so that is just my opinion. The menus are lacking, graphical options are near nonexistant. The lack of content in this game worries me. I really hope that the trend of releasing a short game for less money, doesn't catch on. This game almost offends me as I had been waiting for this game for years. The promise of a reboot of my favorite video game series of all time had me super hyped. However, the game given to me was not a Ratchet and Clank game and if the series keeps up like this, I am going to stop buying them. The only thing I really liked about this game was how they included some of the old planets. I might just be a purist, but I really don't recommend this game. Insomniac is pulling the same **** Bethesda pulled with Skyrim and Fallout 4, where they make game easier and more open to the average person. However, by doing this. they are alienating hardcore fans like me and releasing games that just lack the magic the originals like Fallout 3 or Oblivion had.

While the locales are mostly the same as the original first game, Insomniac wisely decided to add alot of the weapons added on in later installments to the game, giving you a robust selection of weapons to use and upgrade along the way. A collectible card system allows players, like myself, who missed the later games, most notably the PS3 era of games, to catch on those and get an idea of where the series has been recently. The only negative is the awful camera, which will cause a few deaths during everyone's play through. It's extremely frustrating and hard to control to get it right during battles and it is something that needs fixed for future installments. Still, while I thought the game was kinda short, it does have a challenge mode for players wanting to go back in and play for bolts.

You will also see that there is no loading time when you enter or exit a level, which makes the navigation even faster and more enjoyable. Ubisoft has also integrated a new Camera Mode on PS4. By pressing the touchpad of the PS4 joystick, you pause the game and enter this mode, and by moving your fingers on the touchpad, you zoom in and out on the image and drag the image frame; and finally, by pressing the Share button, you can take a photo and share it with everyone. This Camera Mode is a great way to observe in detail all the characters and settings of the game, and a great way of expression to create wacky images with the elements found in the game. On PS4, you can also use the touchpad to scrape the famous Lucky Tickets, then you will really feel like you\u2019re scraping lottery tickets (with the sound of scraping straight from the PS4 joystick). Finally, in this PS4 version, you\u2019ll also find new playable heroes: Assassin Ray (a character inspired by Edward Kenway, the hero of Assassin\u2019s Creed IV: Black Flag), Funky Ray (a delusional character that you can unlock by using Uplay points), and Champion Ray (a character who will be offered to the best players of the community and those who live in this community; this character correspond to the new VIP status, visible in the rankings of online challenges).

I find these new enemies much more scarier than the previous zombies. This game also ditched the 3rd person tank controls and replaced it with an over the shoulder shooter experience. Back in 2005 Resident Evil 4 was the first game to ever do this. Gunplay is amazing and you can really feel the impact from the guns you will be using from the classic pistol and shotgun to the explosive rocket launcher and grenades. The boss fights, a series staple, return here but better than ever and each fight is intense and memorable. The game is very well paced one minute you will be fighting for your life in a creepy village full of crazies to racing through a mine trying to keep balance as monsters attacked you from all sides. The game is also chock full of funny cheesy B movie dialogue that will be sure to bring a grin to your face. The graphics have also aged very well by keeping that stylish Resident Evil look.

A proud work of Capcom and possibly the greatest Resident Evil game ever made. The game has a nice fixed-camera system that makes it feel more immersive. I can explain this by an example: You have 50 bullets in a shotgun but you can't wait for your enemies to come at you so you can mow them down one by one, This is because every enemy that you encounter can be a threat to you.It allows you to use a series of weapons and upgrade them as well as buy equipment from merchants scattered across the map. To combat enemies you need to pick a target and aim at them and use bullets carefully, It expects you to decide which enemy you should kill first (recommended the strongest) In order to succeed but combat is fun and in Resident Evil you'll need to be careful, stealthy and just plain lucky sometimes in order to avoid a tragic end. The story is a bit far-fetched but the game makes it that it works and the tone of horror and seriousness if never dropped even if they throw in some jokes and stereotypes time and time. The tone of the game is horror and the game does a good job into convincing me that I am in danger. Sometimes you will hear creepy noises like crowing birds or the sound of a chainsaw being cranked. The visuals are impressive as well such as dark stormy weather, unimaginable horrific mutant creatures and interactions with the environment that disturbs me; While steal hanging on to it's PS2-like feel and sound effects! In the end you have a solid PS2-port that not only satisfies but delivers more than the original. I can safely comepare Resident Evil 4 to the atmosphere of another great game: The Last of Us. Although the shooting may be a turn-off to some gamers and you occasionally encounter a glitch or an unattractively generated graphic. The game also does a poor job of explaining where you are supposed to go and how you are suppose to get there. However this does not take away from the games appeal and uniqueness that separates it from other games. I would say this is a must play experience because it delivers enjoyable game play for an 11 year old game and allows you to once again play this work of art and classic"], ["Peetja", "User", "6", "I think this may be the most ported game ever...

And I'm happy to say it's every bit as good, if not better than I remembered. I think I actually like it more now than I did when it was initially released. There's a reason it's been re-released on pretty much every console since its creation, and that's because it's an absolute masterpiece that revolutionized video games, specifically third-person shooters. I'll admit, it's not usually scary per say, but it's almost always eerie, and there is a persisting sense of danger outside of the save areas. The atmosphere is constantly dreary, and the game never keeps you in one location too long with needlessly complicated puzzles and backtracking that were prominent in the prior titles in the series. You're always moving from one awesomely designed location to another with varying enemies, which help keep things fresh on your very long, but enjoyable journey. Just when you think you've learned a certain enemy's pattern and begin to feel comfortable, the game throws a new foe at you that attacks you in a completely new way. The game is challenging without being outright frustrating, and the difficulty perfectly inclines as you progress. Mechanically, Resident Evil 4 moves at a slow, methodical pace. But that's part of its charm. Aiming is rather slow, you can't strafe, and the inventory must be opened to change your weapon. But I don't mind any of that at all. It's certainly the most dated part of the game, but it surprisingly works in Resident Evil 4's favor, On a technical level, the game was the pinnacle of it's time. Graphically, it was unmatched on consoles, and the sound and music was, and still is top notch. Although there are a lot of muddy textures, overall the game looks great on the PS4, considering nothing has been touched up, just ported to hi-def. The story, in classic Resident Evil fashion, has a thick narrative, punctuated with many twists and turns. But I find it less convoluted than most of the other entries in the franchise. Even after 12 years, there were some climactic, and iconic moments I hadn't forgotten that are still as amazing today as they were on the Gamecube.

It really lends itself well to the series. With its big spectacles and wonderful gameplay. Resident Evil 6 takes these notions to new heights with its interwoven story and its larger then life characters. Resident Evil 6 is to myself the biggest and best entry in the series and a very well made game in that respect. The story here is the biggest we've seen and the characters are so engaging in their quest to rid bioterrorism from the face of the earth. One of my favorite features in the game is the crossover feature, letting you play with up to four players/people at certain areas of the game its brilliant. The new characters feel very welcoming to the series, and the creature designs are very terrifying. There are four different play styles in the game to cater to each style of Resident Evil fan, retaining a certain uniqueness to each campaign. There is loads to do and many different modes for all varied players. The Mercenaries' mode is the best to date and there are tones of different new modes to choose from. Resident Evil 6 was an absolute amazing game to play with its few jumps scare and action set pieces it was a great experience for a long time Resident Evil fan. Sure their were a lot of action prompts, but those can be turned on or off at players discretion. I have and played all 21 entire in the series of games and this was my favorite by far. Resident evil 4 may be the best entry to most fans in the series,but where do you think the series went wrong from the originals, ill say it, \"Resident Evil 4\" The game is great but their in lies the rub. This is where the series changed into the new direction it is today. Everyone is different, one mans trash is another's treasure as the saying goes, everyone is different with different tastes. How do you bring back the fans of the first five main entries in the series like from 0 to 4 without alienating everyone who loves the later games of the series like 5 the revelations series, 6 and ORC but, there is no denying that this game was the biggest and most exciting Resident Evil to date.

Beautiful and polished, however, under the light, end up showing bad textures. At least game performance is reasonable, with few frames falling.

Yeah sure,it's not the same Resident Evil that used to be, but it was still a fun game to play ( better than 5 in my opinion). You can play a campaign up to 7-8 hours ( 4 campaigns in total, not 3) on a harder difficulty. There are a lot of quick time events,sure but I think that they're set for the right moments, an example is when you get grabbed by a zombie, of course you have to try something to escape right? And QTE are also used to enhance some cutscenes, making them more intense, not to mention that on Easy difficulty those cutscenes QTE will be done automatically..that's something no one talks about \u00ac_\u00ac . There's also a lot of variation in the game, from driving(flying,etc) to some light puzzles. The graphics aren't bad either and the storyline is pretty alright ( not the best but acceptable). Ammo is pretty scarce as well and the environment is well made. It's not horror but Leon's campaign has a little level of creepiness. The only bad thing about this game that I can say, is the online mode. While Agent Hunt is a great idea, it's entirely broken, you can barely move or do anything useful. It turns from fun to a chore. Mercenaries it's okay I guess, more intense ( a little bit),but not that much better than RE5. Annnd..the other modes you have to pay for...Ustanak was meh , great idea to look at but when you get to play it, it's kinda bad in my opinion. They should've put way more effort in the Online modes (that's cheap) . It's also a bit sad that the costumes are removed from the campaign.

I am 30 years old with 2 older brothers, the oldest of which is 10 years older.  It was him that came back from the store with a Playstation, a new T.V and of coarse Resident Evil after getting his student loans and financial aide on march 25 or 26, 1996 :-).    I I know the date only because it was a few days after RE's initial release in the U.S. We spent almost 13 hours straight playing it.  That started my infatuation with the RE series.  For some context, and I know most might disagree but as far as my favorite (I'm not saying its the BEST one, just my favorite) Resident Evil 2 has to be my favorite out of all of them.  I was amazed it came with two discs to play as different characters, whose stories intertwine all throughout the game.  I know, I know you aren't here to read about some punk's past with RE.  I just want to give the reader some context.  RE7 is definitely a return to RE's roots as a survival horror game.  I must say I was super weary about RE7 being in first person but it really does a fantastic job of making the setting and enemies even more unsettling.  Almost in the same way as the original.  Like in the first few RE games, that third person perspective coupled with the tank controls made every corridor, and really long hallway super suspenseful, all because you simply couldn't see anything that was more than 5 or so feet from your character.  The first person perspective works somewhat in the same way.  That cone of vision is super limited, giving you a very uneasy feeling.  I am not ashamed to admit that it is f@#king scary as all hell.  Not just cheap jump scares either.  I am talking 100% bonafide terrifying.  One gripe I have, and I don't want to spoil anything for you here so I will be super vague, but it is really difficult at times knowing when you are supposed to fight or run.  This lead to being very wasteful in terms of ammunition, and getting myself in really bad situations.  You could say that it just lead to an even more cautious play style, but an annoyance none the less.  I am not real sure about anyone else but for me using VR is the BEST way to play, and honestly could not see myself playing any other way.  I'm shocked I haven't seen many people that was all that impressed with the VR gameplay.  Anyway, if you are a long time RE fan I think you will like this one.

RE: Biohazard uses a combination of sight, sound, imagery and imagination to create one of the scariest games on any home console.

It reminds me a little too much of Alien Isolation in that the game can be brutally unfair at times. Seriously, it may take me a month to get through this game just because of the difficulty in some parts. That's not a good thing, I still have 5 unopened games that I need to get to before Gran Turismo Sport comes out in May. Another big gripe I have is the puzzle to combat ratio. I wish there were less puzzles and more combat in the final product. I've put 5 hours into the game, and I think that I've only killed 4 enemies to date, but I've solved at least 7 puzzles already. That ratio is way off, and the game would be so much better if it didn't force you to solve strange shadow puzzles in the middle of an abandoned Louisiana estate.

I didn't finish the game.  I tried to. I really did, but I became too bored to continue.  With that said, I actually like a lot of what I played.  The first person view was very effective, and the first hour was masterfully executed.  But, it just started falling apart after that, and became a puzzle-oriented, backtracking mess.  I'll admit, I've never enjoyed the puzzle sections in the Resident Evil games, which is why I enjoy part 4 the most, as well as a plethora of other reasons, but I digress. The location in Resident Evil 7 is actually very intriguing and atmospheric, with amazing graphics to boot most of the time. But it all became very stale and boring after I had to endless pass through each section over and over again while being stalked by enemies who refused to die. You better get used to endlessly seeing the same, rather small areas, time and time again, because you're stuck in more or less the same location for the entirety of the game. But, the game is a decent throwback to parts 1-3, and that's actually my biggest gripe with Resident Evil 7. It feels too much like an older video game, with artificial, unrealistic barriers impeding your progress. Ironically, the more it tried to be like early Resident Evil titles, the less enjoyable it was for me. These old conventions just make it feel dated, and stuck in the past, with nothing new to offer. However, the dialogue, opposed to most Resident Evil games, is actually pretty good, and there are quite a few clever jump scares that effectively add to the tension.  I enjoyed the optional VHS tapes that expand the story as well. Furthermore, the music and sound is excellent.  But at the end of the day, my time with Resident Evil 7 (about 5-6 hours in) seemed like a waste. I simply found no reason to continue to the end credits.  It's unfortunate, because Resident Evil 7 does a lot right, and is actually rather excellent in small bursts, but the artificial \"gamey\" elements really took the fun out of it for me. The longer my journey went on, the less engaged I became, which is quite a shame, because I feel Resident Evil 7 had so much going for it.  Oh well, there's always part 8 to look forward to.

I then did a speedrun on easy and did it in 3 and a half hours. Madhouse is quite a fun experience while it lasts. Unfortunately it does not offer too much replay value. Sure, running around with infinite ammo is fun for a few plays then it loses a bit of luster, which is why I had to bump my rating down a couple notches, but if you can get it cheap or you have lots of GameStop credit, I recommend trying it out.

For so long it seems the series was in a nose dive spinning further and further away from its horror roots, and turning into an almost sometimes off-putting action shooter. RE7 is a welcoming throwback to the golden age of gaming and a return to what many old fans would agree is what made Resident Evil so amazing, to begin with. Although the FPS is a new take on the series it's a surprisingly pleasing addition that emphasizes the overall terrifying environment around you. I thoroughly enjoyed the Baker family mystery. When I was not on the edge of my seat in terror, I found myself wrapped up in trying to figure out what happened to make this disturbing family become what the have.  On a mechanical level, the games runs very smooth and offers a wide range of weapons more satisfying than the last. The overall graphics are stunning and utilize the full power of the PS4 which (is in my opinion) one of the best-looking games on the console to date. My only complaints derive from nitpicking put I will state them anyhow, personally, I would have liked to seen more intricate or at least more unique boss fights, and the DLC left something to be desired. It wasn't bad by any means, just not worth the $9.99 I paid to play. The first DLC batch comes off as mini games they could have thrown into the main game or at least should have offered after beating the main storyline, much like in other RE installments that gave us The Mercenaries, and Assignment Ada mini games upon completion. With all of that being said, the good far outweighs the bad elements and RE7 puts itself near the top of the best in the series.

The visual jump scares seldom feel cheap in part due to the masterful sound design. Making people jump isn\u2019t a difficult task. However, making people terrified to progress the plot is a daunting task to pull off. Resident Evil 7 absolutely succeeds in pulling off what developer/publisher Capcom set out to accomplish. After the failure of RE6, the need for the series to return to the survival horror genre became clear. Horror is all about maintaining an atmosphere. Walking down a corridor, Ethan Winter (the surrogate for the player) might hear some variety of crash off in the next room or in the room above. The mansion is lived in (a slightly inaccurate phrase) and a sense of foreboding never escapes the player except for around the ending. The sound design mixed in with phenomenal limited lighting merge in encouraging the player never be overconfident in a given environment. Unlike previous entries, the locations are realistically scaled down. The Baker homestead never features a room or ground that feels out of place. In other words, the property is very much one might find in reality. Conversely, the game\u2019s need to feature a puzzle at every turn suspends belief every once in awhile. In the end, the limited environmental scope aids in augmenting the horror. The developers painstakingly created the home to a disturbing degree. Every nook and cranny of the home serve a purpose in telling the Baker family\u2019s story. The player is rewarded at great cost for exploring the environment. In addition, the exploration feeds into a very enjoyable item management system. All of the items encountered are useful. In order to make backpack space, the player has to really decide what is the most useful item in a given situation. Looking through your inventory doesn\u2019t stop the game time. You could be looking at the very low ammo of a given gun and suddenly come under attack. In most fights, the best solution is often to run away until a more advantageous moment. The narrative lasts little more than ten hours. The duration of the experience ensures the plot never drags or overstays its welcome. The mysteries of the circumstances surrounding Ethan Walker are more than enough to ensure the player fights their fear. The player won\u2019t be able to stop themselves from enjoying their twisted adventure with the Baker family."], ["Kenmei", "User", "9", "After the disappointment that was Resident Evil 6, Capcom went back to the horror roots with this one and set the series on what hopefully is a new path.

So those of you who have played the original '96 game, are still in for surprises around some corners, and challenges that will make resources vital. The dialogue, though still a bit cheesy, is multiple levels up from that of the delightfully awkward original script. It remains similar enough to bring back all the memories of the original, but separates itself enough from the past to intrigue, creating an almost parallel world experience with how similar but more thought out the new dialogue is. I found myself both listening to the new, but in my head quoting the old, making for some laughs. Once again, those first person views of doors opening, tight corridors with the moaning undead near by, and limping through halls praying for ammo and health all have your hair on end, and it is a most welcome return. The Mansion is only slightly redesigned enough to make you lull into comfort, thinking you have the situation under control before springing something new on you such as a new zombie placement, or unfamiliar room, or retelling an old experience in less predictably ways. The results are fun and frightening. The Mansion is alive with creaks and shutters, moving light and flashes of lighting, shadows and mirrors, fog and water, all pulling you in deeper than ever before. This is Resident Evil in all its Survival Horror glory. It would be impossible to rate this any lower than a perfect score, seeing as it is a better version of a past masterpiece, and then improved once again on top of that. Get lost in Spencer Mansion, and take a bloody bite out of the game that started it all, the one and only, Resident Evil."], ["midway23", "User", "8", "In all honesty, this is one of the most pointless reviews I have ever done for a video game (including Metacritic and YouTube videos).

This is the most unfortunate piece, because I love the overall feel of the game. It is kinda like Luigi's Mansion, which is a game I have played a lot.   Another thing that I hate is that your inventory is so small, and that wouldn't be bad but you can't even drop items. On top of that, if my inventory is full and I want to use a healing item, too bad because I need space just to pick it up and use it right away. Also you only can save at certain points and need special items to save. Sometimes the points at which you can save have an item on top of them, so if you can't pick the item up you can't save either.

Revelations tries to be more horror focused than RE6 but includes too many action elements to make it a true horror game. The player is given way too many types of weapons such as pistols, shotguns, machine guns, and rocket launchers. The gameplay often involves the player searching for key items while fighting monsters to get to their objective. The original survival horror focused RE games had these elements but they often gave the player less weapons and ammo. The game's main setting of the cruise ship the Queen Zenobia is a great setting where the player backtracks throughout the ship to uncover more of the story. I liked this feature and made me really pay attention to the ship as it slowly sinks into the ocean. Revelations includes too few horror elements than it promised. The fish themed enemies are well designed and make great jump scares but are easily shot down by the player. The setting of the Queen Zenobia maybe a good idea for a game setting but in areas it lacks visual flare or detail that would make it more memorable. The main large spaces on the ship are well designed and stunning looking for a game that was a port of a 3DS game and really show off the setting. The graphics are great for a 3DS title but are blurry and dated looking by PS4 standards. The story is the game\u2019s weakest point. The story follows the main characters Jill Valentine and her partner Parker as they board the Queen Zenobia on a special mission. Many other playable characters will also show up in the story as they try to figure out the mystery behind the Queen Zenobia. The fact that the main characters are super soldiers takes away greatly from the tension and makes the situation feel less dire. The biggest problem Revelations suffers from is the fact that it can\u2019t choose between being a horror or action game. The gameplay is too action centric and so is the story but the monsters and setting are more horror themed. Luckily, RE7 would find the riddle to this mystery and make a real horror game. I recommend playing Resident Evil 7 instead of this game in fact.

Uncharted with rpg elements, my mind was blown.  Now we have the sequel to that game, and while it is safe to call this a good game, I wished it would've been more \"fresh\". After all it is literally more of the same of the 2013 game, but with a new story/characters and a tad-bigger open world. First the positives. The action set pieces in this game are wonderful and  a treat to play when it triggers. The open world is bigger and there are more tombs to explore, collectibles to collect, an even a few side quests thrown in to mix things up a little. I enjoyed all of these elements,although to an extent. The rpg elements and general gameplay are carbon copy of the 2013 version, so in my book it's also good. And that's when my complaints about this game arise. There is literally nothing new about this game, except for a couple gadgets and story which in my opinion was generic, made worse by the fact there were no character development in this game at all; everyone you meet was just to push you toward the next objective. The game felt soul-less in the story and character standpoint, and my second time around with Lara, I realized how devoid of personality she has throughout the game. Without  a good story, and game play that felt actually like the same in 2013, not to mention the animals and rpg level up system is about an 90% copy and paste job from 2013, I just wished there were more new things in this game. It's an bigger open world, but we do the exact same thing in the 2013 reboot. Yes, there are more tombs, but they were all very simple, ok at best. The worst part is the rewards were unsatisfying. To end, it may seem like I hated this game, but I enjoyed it, although not to the extent of an uncharted or even its 2013 counterpart. I just really wished it added on from the 2013 game for this one, and seeing as I didn't enjoy the story, the game play just felt too similar for me to enjoy it as much as I did in 2013.

Firstly, the game was advertised on TV as having over 50 hours of gameplay, but the story campaign is only about 5-8 hours long. My play time was 21 hours and 27 minutes with 100% game completion including collectibles meaning the other 10 or so hours were just hunting animals to upgrade skills and gear, collectibles as well as solving puzzles in optional tombs.

It was all I ever played and I loved it. It was a huge game in my family. We always threw parties and had such a blast. I've kept those memories very close to me as they brought friendships and relationships closer. I bought every rock band game and each one amazed me, I think Rock Band 2 was my favorite. Had a really great setlist and brought in new game modes that I really enjoyed. Sadly, Rock Band 4 didn't do that for me. I was very excited when they announced it, but, the game is too broken. Without MTV and EA maybe thats why it didn't do as good? The setlist wasn't great and I can't even play the game. I've updated all instruments and yet they still don't work and I've recalibrated multiple times and sometimes the calibration can't even read the instruments. I've loved what you were putting out Harmonix. Guitar Hero 1 and 2 were incredible and the three Rock Bands were a lot of fun, but my family can't even enjoy playing this game. The game can be enjoyed if we weren't hoping for higher scores from previous scores, but other then that, the game isn't in sync at all and maybe they should update it.

Rock Boshers DX was immediately gratifying for me, being of the Atari/Amiga age made the graphical direction of the game a fun bit of nostalgia. I haven't seen many developers going for the straight 8-bit rough retro look (think Nidhogg), but honestly Rock Boshers does a nice job with it. There is a light comedic air about the game and most mechanics are handled quite well. I found myself entertained at the twists the game kept throwing on the otherwise generic looking dungeons, and the objectives were never overly complicated past the point of \"grab this key, unlock this door\" giving the game a Doom-esque feel about it. I also never got very attached to the main character, despite her jaded background and what ended up being one of the weirder stories in recent memory. Here-in lies the problem with this graphics style, its very hard to build plot or characterization when limited in what you can actually SHOW the player. It takes a bit of imagination and lots of patience on the users part to really appreciate a game like this, and most kids (and a fair amount of adults) don't have it. We are much too spoiled by the gorgeous scenery and character profiles that have come to define the last decade of gaming to really appreciate the sprites in the same way. Especially when they are not much more than a blob of any two colors. I personally enjoyed my time with Rock Boshers DX, and as always I applaud and thank developers who give me that good old nostalgic feeling, but its going to be a harsh uphill battle to make anything in this style appealing again. 6/10, check it out if/when it goes on sale, it may just surprise you.

In addition to the arcade controls, the return of 3-Click swings appeals to nostalgic gamers who prefer to set power and accuracy by tapping a button rather than moving a thumbstick. Those looking for an extra challenge can turn on Tour settings. When playing with Tour controls, the length of your backswing and speed of your follow through determine power, while the club path through the ball will be the most important factor in accounting for accuracy. Fans can also mix and match all three settings to create their own custom gameplay style. Courses themselves also affect how your shots are played, as firmer, links-style courses like St. Andrews provides more bounce and roll, while softer courses such as TPC Sawgrass have less bounce and be more receptive to spin.
