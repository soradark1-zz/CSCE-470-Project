Throughout the game I was having great fun and I earned a well-deserved Platinum Trophy on it. The story is about Delsin Rowe, an average stencil artist in Salmon Bay, an area outside Seattle. When Delsin and his brother Reggie witness a truck full of conduits (people infected with special powers) crash, they go to search for survivors and find Hank, a conduit with smoke powers, who unexpectedly gives his powers to Delsin. Then he chases after Hank and tries to find a way to get rid of his powers, which he is scared of at the moment. At the end of their chase, Delsin meets Brooke Augustine, head of the Department of Unified Protection (DUP). Augustine shoots concrete into Delsin's legs, knocking him out. Then Delsin goes to Seattle to deal with Augustine - a usual revenge story. Over the course of the game, you move around with smoke powers, then neon, then video and finally concrete. When you unlock one power, you can drain from the source of one of the other powers to use it again. You can also do something that doesn't require your powers as a side activity - Stencil Art. You can also kill DUP secret agents, destroy DUP hidden cameras, collect Informant audio logs, destroy DUP mobile command units and drain shards (your upgrade currency) from tracker drones. Do all of the side activities in one district and you'll unlock the District Showdown mission, where you vandalise a DUP billboard and obliterate all of the DUP reinforcements. Once you've done that, the district will be mostly free from DUP attacks. Throughout the game you are also brought into a morality system where you have to choose to be good or evil by doing particular actions and choosing paths in the story. Some of the evil actions don't really fit Delsin's personality, however. This is something that may need improving. The game looks amazing and shows off the power of the PS4 with incredibly detailed motion capture and facial expressions. Overall, this is a great game only brought down to a 9/10 by evil actions that don't fit Delsin's personality and not much reason to keep playing once you've completed everything to 100%."], ["TakeshiR", "User", "8", "Infamous Second Son , was one of the first games on ps4 and unique that showed that the ps4 came .

The graphics really show what next-gen (current-gen now) have to offer. If you want a game to show off your new PS4 to your friends, this is it. The game play works very well in my opinion. The game is responsive, and it's a very enjoyable experience to blow up everything the D.U.P. has to offer. But this gets old after a while. You start to just do the same things over and over again. This is InFamous Second Son's largest problem, repetitiveness. Very similar missions and tasks are repeated many times. While I never got completely bored of the game, it became more of a chore towards the end. When playing a game, you should not want the game to end, you should want to keep on coming back for more. Story wise, this game is kind of a letdown. There was a lot of potential, but it wasn't fulfilled. At the very beginning, the game does a great job of setting up Delsin and his companions. The middle of the game has a loose story, but most of the time all you know is that you need to blow something up, or catch someone. If the middle of the game had more cut scenes, this could have been avoided, but almost all of the cutscenes are at the beginning, with a few towards the end as well. I know I have said it already, but the environments are absolutely beautiful. Seattle seems alive, but at the same time, very dull. There are many characters roaming the streets, but none of them are very smart, using the same animations and dialogue over and over again. This takes away from the realism of Seattle. There aren't very many memorable locations either. This creates an unmemorable experience for a lot of the game. The powers that Delsin uses look absolutely amazing and are a blast to use. Learning new abilities are what keep me coming back to the game, which makes the game difficult to play more than once. So far I've only played the evil side of Delsin. While there are minor changes on the good side story wise, there are very few power wise. Generally, everything is the same. This makes the game a one time play through, until you have forgotten some of the story and feel like playing again. The main story probably takes about 10 hours to complete, not including side missions. For some, that may not be worth $60. If you are a big fan of open world superhero games, want something to show off your new PS4 with, or just need a game to play on PS4, you will probably enjoy this game.

The story is good enough to get the player immersed into the game. The detail and graphics are sheer eye candy. The detail and shading in the lighting will definitely catch your eye. Get your hands on this game and use a \"karma charged\" power and you'll see exactly what I mean. The side missions get more difficult with each one completed and the enemies vary in number so the repetition factor is kept to a minimum.

The characters were good, but of the five or so supporting characters only one was fleshed out much, but even then, it wasn't enough to make me care much when that character died. Double spoilers, it's Reggie. Abigail \"Fetch\" Walker held a lot of promise; she lived on the streets of Seattle with her brother, and both were \"taken in\" by a gang of drug dealers. They both got addicted, she killed her brother using her neon powers while in a drug-fueled rage and decides to take out her anger on the drug dealers that use Seattle as their stomping grounds. Good, dark back story that is not yet a cliche, but will be soon, thanks to Breaking Bad. Sucker Punch had a chance to use this character and make her great, but they didn't. A few \"drug busts\" later and you don't see her again until the end of the game. Another side character was Eugene Sims. He could have been good too, a withdrawn kid who discovers he has powers a year after his mother, a senator, votes to give money to the DUP. Harsh, and could have had good family dynamic issues... But no. Sucker Punch makes him a gamer, and a very typical, weird, virgin-type gamer... Which makes you wonder, does Sucker Punch not realize that this is the person that their game is supposed to appeal to?

Infamous: Second Son is special as it was supposed to be the game that would sell the PS4 similar to how Titanfall was supposed to sell the XBO. These games were hype to hell. Titanfall while fun missed some basic FPS needs, probably brought by the developers inexperiance. If I reviewed it, it would pro...bably get a 7/10. What about Infamous: Second Son? I mean it's developed by Sucker Punch who made the previous installments and the Sly Cooper series, so you think with this, the game would top of the line, right? Unfortunately no. This game is a huge dissapointment. First I have to talk about the story, It is pretty boring. It amounts to: Character gets powers(conduit); Character is attacked by military against powers(D.U.P.) who attack his people(who will die); Character recruits others with powers; Character finds main boss and beats her. Thats it. It's a shame too, because the actual characters are actually interesting. They develop and have outstanding and even dark backstories. With special mention going to Fetch. She's a former junkie whose parents sold her out to the D.U.P, but she is saved by her brother, they seek refuge from drug dealers and become addicts. Her addiction causes her to kill her brother by accident and as vengence she kills drug dealers. That's good stuff, but if the story is bland than good characters can't save it. With that said the Moral system returns, but again it isn't interesting. In the last game your choices have big impacts, here it seems so small a detail. And the endings are barely different, so causes you to wonder if you should play again. Plus being evil actively contradicts the story and of what Delsin(the main character) is trying to accomplish **** up the story as a whole. I swear by the end I was saying wtf? With that said the Graphics are pretty good and the world is detailed though there is a moment where I got shot into a building(you can't go into buildings) and got stuck because of a glitch. Though this is the only one I found in the game. But of course what matters is the gameplay. So, how is it? First returning is the fact that you absorb material to attain empowerment. What I really like are the powers. In previous games the powers, while fun, were also generic. Here the powers are pretty inventive. By the end you will have Smoke, Neon, Concrete and my favorite Video. These can be upgraded by collecting blast shards and what you get adds tons of fun, because you get certain abilities depending on your Karma(whether it be good or evil). With these you can develop your own style of gamplay. There is also stuff to do in order to increase your karma. Spray-painting, freeing people and drug bust increase good karma and killing civillians of any kind increases bad karma. The main goal aside from completing the story is driving the D.U.P. from the city. This is accomplished by beating up D.U.P, destroying their equipment and taking over their zones. Now reviewers will say the combat isn't that good and I disagree. With all the ways to take down enemies it makes battles versitile. However the problem is the enemies themselves. There isn't a huge veriety in the enemies which means there isn't a need to change your strategy much. The Boss fights are a huge Dissapointment. They aren't even the least be creative or fun. What happened to an awesome boss like Kessler? Augustine is a poor replacement. Hell, the most creative \"He Who Dwells\", is also the most annoying. Fortunately you won't have to worry about enemies for too long as the main storyline is only five hours long. you could do tjhe other Karma and double it but come on that is short for a next-gen sandbox game. With all this I stand by what I think. This game isn't bad, but with all that hype, it's dissapointing. So this game is pretty much like Titanfall and will have a score of 7/10. This game had a lot of good things going for it, but fell short. It needed a better story and enemies to complement the cool powers. I would try it, but only as a rental."], ["Alexy", "User", "10", "The best PS4 game yet. I enjoyed every single detail f the power. Well balanced, story is good enough, graphics is awesome.

It is the first exclusive for the PS4 which I have since the launch so I'll be damned to not pick this up. It took a while though, we all see the adds Sony is pushing us so it's hard to ignore the game. When I read the reviews I wasn't all that psyched, seeing the in-game footage was amazing but I didn't had a connection with the franchise. Played an Infamous game on the PS3 once, free with PS Plus, but after an hour I ditched it. This morning after skipping class I was watching twitch tv, by accident because I don't do that much. When I saw people playing the game, I was feeling a little excited. After watching a guy clear one district (a thing you need to do in the game) I was hooked and instantly bought it on the PS store. And really, don't have any regrets because it is really an amazing game. The story isn't that brilliant like a Last of Us and it isn't a sandbox game like GTA, but the things you can do are bloody amazing. Jumping on roofs, hovering between them and whooshing into thin sand to reach the next rooftop, it never gets old. I've read that it's a lot of repetition but what game isn't? The touchpad controls are worked in nicely, like the speaker in the controller. The game itself is pretty challenging  and it does take some time to find a way to get things done. The character is pretty funny, some things make me laugh out loud which is a good thing because only The Stick of Truth made me laugh in a game since a long while (GTA..). So yeah, 12-13 hours to end the game sounds right, but you can play a good hero and a bad one, so it's worth the replay I think.

The story is about Delsin, who finds out that he is a conduit, after a van crashes on it's way to Washington. the D.U.P's head, Brooke Augustine interrogates his village and puts them in danger of death, from her concrete powers. As Delsin, you have to head to Seattle, along with your cop brother, Reggie, to gain her concrete powers (because your power is to take other people powers).

If you played infamous 1 or 2, you pretty much already played this game. By fat the most significant addition is the ability to change between three different powers throughout the game, a more fleshed-out version of what infamous 2 did with the fire/ice paths. There is also a massive emphasis on mobility, it is very rare that you will actually need to climb a building the old-fashioned way, this time around you can blast from one end of the city to the other without much effort once you get the needed abilities. Combat is almost identical to previous entries, although now there is actually incentive to subduing enemies for anything other than karma (which has always been kind of a pointless system) and trophies. Playing carefully leads to super-attacks, or likewise going on killing-sprees, depending on whether you are good or bad. The greatest disappointment of this game is that bland karma system. There is no middle path, absolutely no incentive to change part-way through the game, and the plotline is essentially the same either way. If they had found a way to elaborate on that and expand it in ways that allow for more nuanced character development and customization and accurately capture the complexities of what being \"good\" or \"bad\" means, it would have injected alot more life into this game. The sidequests are pretty boring and feel like chores. Collecting shards-galore to power-up becomes tedious. Melee combat still feels under-explored. They got rid of the cover-system, which would have helped given that Delsin is just as fragile as Cole ever was (although there are some interesting new ways to heal yourself in combat). The characters are so-so, don't really affect much, and feel like pieces of furniture is a gorgeously decorated house. As a demonstration and a glimpse into what the PS4 is capable of, it makes a fine showcase and is easily the best-looking open world game ever made, although you won't know it until you get to the second island. Occasionally the game does find that sweet spot when you are flying around, blasting enemies suspended in the air, blowing up convoys with rockets, smashing groups of enemies to bits with ground-pounds, and summoning small armies of monsters to do your bidding while you are invisible and making your way behind the enemy flank. And when all of that comes together, it is one heck of an experience to be had. It's just unfortunate there are humdrum chore-lists in between and a flimsy plot that doesn't even establish a world that makes sense or is interesting, remember that ending of infamous 2 that left everyone guessing? They glaze over it in a boring DLC side-quest line.

After playing this, I felt a little shortchanged. The game is vibrant, the setting is stunning, there's more powers to play with, collectibles are abundant, the characters are solid and likeable, and the dialogue is funny enough to make a humorless guy chuckle. Sucker Punch added some other cool stuff, such as graffiti posters and zone warfare, and the powers are amazingly balanced. However, in other aspects, the game seems to feel overrated. First of all, it took me probably TEN HOURS to beat the game on Normal, and that's adding up time I spent to liberate a couple zones and collect enough blast shards to max everything. The plot's great and the boss battles are intense, but the major characters only appear for maybe 1-3 missions tops (Except for Delsin's brother Reggie), and that kills it for me. It would have been great if there was some way to help the conduits you find in their endeavors, and maybe add some more random encounters. I didn't exactly feel all that heroic after maxing out on Good Karma, as NPC's don't really do a whole lot of different stuff other than make some comments. The AI is NOT EVEN CLOSE to flawless. Enemies sometimes run around acting like idiots, especially in the beginning of the game where they're laughably easy to defeat, and although there are more types of enemies introduced near the halfway point, they still act idiotic at times, running straight at you without firing their guns. I could drone on for a bit of a while about the flaws, but I'll put it this way: after I do a play through on Evil Karma, I don't think I'll ever be picking up the disc and putting it in again, and I'm already having a hard time thinking about playing it even now. Just rent the game for a few days and you'll probably finish both Karmic paths in 15-ish hours. Only my love for the series prevents me from going below the green. Come on Sucker Punch, we need more content for a game like this. Add a little more background for the new guys, more story, and other areas for us to explore. Don't ditch important characters after a couple missions and suddenly throw them in the last mission. Please, if you're gonna make a sequel, add some new radiant stuff and weather effects rather than just cloudy days. I know Seattle isn't exactly Los Angeles, but we have sun out here sometimes, and it would be nice if we had other weather patterns in the game.

I completed my first playthrough in 8 hours, I wasn't even rushing, this was 100% 1st playthrough completion in practically one day. Naturally to see both the Hero and Infamous endings you'll want to play it twice, which totaled up to a grand 14 hours. For the amount of money they demanded for this game that is simply disgraceful. Aside from that I found Delsin a poor replacement for Cole; While Cole was the sort of character who could have gone either way, being good or bad based on the short straws life had handed him, Delsin's motives were purely altruistic and any decisions he makes along the Infamous karma route don't develop him as a character at all, they just make him out to be a punk. On that note the good and bad karma decisions in this game were weak.

But what? Another InFamous but on ps4. Oh how I was wrong, and I'm glad I decided to test myself on this wrong. Firstly, the open world of the game is made of course not perfect, but very good. Run / jump and fly over it really brings aesthetic pleasure. A sort of a mixture of GTA, Prototype, past InFamous games and something else, which together made \u200b\u200bthe city great. Secondly, it is the main character. How I got tired of images \"bald\" Rambo in each game. Huge, with big muscles, a kind of carbon paper with different hairstyles in all games. Delsin Rowe - this is absolutely the first protagonist in games of this genre, which is awesome. It's actually a young man, I believe the developers that he is really a man who surprised that he can do some strange things!

Of the minuses I note the lack of desire to play in the \"Free-Roam\", well, the logical end of the game there are enough already.

It's up to you to find what you like the most. Rest assured though, moving around the city is incredibly fun, not only are the combat powers different, the traversal powers are too. Second Son really blue balls you with the story. It's extremely short, something that has been happening with each subsequent release of the series. The characters are much more interesting and relatable, but you never see enough of them and they see very little development. Side missions are barely tied to the story, an instance barely varies from the rest of each of its type. The karma system stays black and white, it's never been hard to make a decision, you're a good guy, so you should make the good choice. There's no reason to do otherwise. Not much of the story even changes based on your decisions. Karma plays a part in combat, where you must combo actions differently as good or evil in order to earn a special karmic ability.

Visually this game is stunning, the powers, the town, and the animations (especially the facial ones) are all incredible. Gameplay wise the controls are smooth and responsive and Sucker Punch actually did a decent job of making use of some of the dualshock controllers unique features without making it feel too gimmicky. The additon of \"hipfire\" makes the combat much more fluid and helps add movement and flow to the combat. And the powers do feel unique from each other and none of them are overpowered enough to make the others obsolete. However there are some things that keep this game from being any higher than a solid 8-8.5/10. First of all, the enemy AI occasionly bugs out at close range and just stops for a bit, nothing too bad and it will probably be patched later on but still kinda detracts from the action. Second, even halfway through the game and there is still only one enemy faction which does make the fights a bit stale but this somewhat countered by the relatively diverse number of enemies in this one faction. Third, the objectives do get somewhat repetitive when you're clearing the districts but this will only bother people who want to 100% the game. Overall one of (if not the best) game on PS4 at the moment and I would highly recommend it to series veterans (like myself) or to people new to franchise that are curious.

There's a good selection of powers to use and upgrade, and exploring the city never feels tiring at all because you can do it both parkour style and use your newfound powers to get about more quickly and easily. Helping, or killing citizens, be good or be bad, that's what i love about the InFamous games, and this one takes it up the next level. The story's pretty decent, nothing special by any means. What i love second most about this game is the character portraits. Delsin Rowe is 10 times more likable than Cole ever was in the previous games. He's funny, and absolutely LOVES having superpowers and that's what's so cool about him, and i don't blame him when playing the game. All of the characters from his brother Reggie and the three conduits: Hank, Fetch and Eugene. You genuinely care for them, because they're so round and unique. Even Augustine the main villain, is one my favorite video game villains of all time. There's just something about her, that makes you feel she could really be some government evil military super **** like in the movies. The voice acting and her appearance all the way from her face and hair to the trench coat and boots, she's really believable and i think SuckerPunch really made an effort with her and all of the characters not to make them forgettable like most others from the previous titles. The boss battles are also super cool, especially the last one is epic. The only downside to this game is how short it is. You're definitely gonna see the end credits roll sooner than you'd like. There's not much to do outside of the main story either. There's only five side quests in total in each of the districts and that includes the district showdowns. There are a lot of drones and people to interact with to get your karma meter filling but it's too easy and too soon you've unlocked all of your powers and districts. Even if you play the game twice as both evil and good, it's just not enough to justify the length. I really hope that Delsin Rowe will return in the sequel, i really dig him. And it would just feel too boring and degrading to just have only one superpower again when you can have four in this one.

The Karma system plays an important part in deciding what kind of play through is achieved. The choices between good and evil are left to the player and its effects will radiate through the story and the powers that can be obtained. Seattle is an absolutely gorgeous open world setting and while it lacks the abundance of large buildings that the previous games had being able to climb up the iconic Space Needle more than makes up for it.

Also the game is incredibly short, easily beatable in a day if you play for long periods of time.

Other than the graphics (which were impressive), this game is a boring mess that fails to deliver in every way imaginable. For a game that is supposed to be centered around having superpowers, it certainly doesn't make you feel powerful at all. Too often you are surrounded by a horde of enemies that haven't both guns and, for some reason, superpowers (which is stupid, considering that they're supposed to be hunting down anybody with superpowers). I found myself being forced to run away from fights while I wait for my health to regenerate. Seriously? The combat itself feels broken and forces you to play a certain way. M\u00eal\u00e9e combat, though available, is almost never an option because you just get shot by more enemies when you attempt it, forcing the game to become a shooter with weak shooter mechanics. If there were at least some kind of targeting system, it might have been more bearable. Additionally, the gameplay is repetitive. Time after time you are forced to go to some D.U.P. controlled area, wipe out the enemies, and blow something up, all while fighting the same boring enemies. The powers which you are given make little sense. Even though it is supposed to be a comic book style game with super powers, that doesn't mean the powers should be something stupid. Video powers? Are you serious with that? There is a power set that lets you drain the power out of TVs and summon creatures from the screen. It makes no sense at all. Finally there is the story. It is poorly written and weak in almost every aspect. I found it to be predictable and full of plot holes. As mentioned previously, the primary antagonist, which is tasked with hunting down conduits/bio-terrorists are themselves people who possess superpowers. This already shows that there is a giant hole in the foundation of the plot. On top of that, the characters are boring, generic, and not memorable in the slightest. The back and forth nature of the relationship between Delsin and Reggie that switches between being Reggie being supportive of Delsin and treating him as a freak because of his abilities makes no sense, and bugged me throughout the entire game. For all that Infamous: Second Son tries to do, it fails in almost every way.

When playing the first two, I often felt like I was forcing myself to play them, just because they were PS3 exclusives. But Second Son, whilst not quite being a system seller, is worth playing on its own merits--if only because it makes using superpowers SO MUCH fun, with added power variety that its prequels totally lacked. When creating the original InFAMOUS, Sucker Punch tried so hard to escape the cute talking animals of Sly Cooper that they were known for that they drained all life, colour and personality from it: forcing you to play as a balding Neo-Nazi lookalike called Cole, complete with a Batman-esque 'badarse' voice. It's saying a lot that the most/only likable character in those games was a fat, jealous and traitorous sidekick. In contrast, Second Son's lead (Delsin) has a naturally sarcastic sense of humour and something the previous lead lacked: likability. This is true for the supporting cast, as well; especially the lead's serious-yet-funny older brother. What's more, gone is the trying too hard dull/dreary colour palette of old: Seattle is - visually - very bright and lifelike, yet not overly so. Clearly, Sucker Punch learned from many of their previous mistakes. But, sadly, Second Son is held back by Sucker Punch seemingly having been content creating a short-lived spin-off that demonstrates the PS4's graphics with its jaw-dropping cut-scenes, as a opposed to creating a truly great game that was meant to last and be continued."], ["Nel", "User", "6", "Interesting characters, the gameplay itself is solid.

Does that make it any less of a game?  Absolutely not.  (Disclaimer: I've never played InFamous 2.)  Second Son is a good game.  One of the best on the PS4 that isn't some re-release of a game that came out a year before.  Second Son doesn't have a golden story or characters, and I personally don't like the completely Black/White morality choices, but goddamn is it a fun game to play.  Its more or less a third person shooter without a cover system, but instead relies on traversing rooftop to rooftop to avoid getting totally rekt (which is easy to do), and picking off enemies one at a time with the four original and cool powers that you get over the course of the game.  Each of these powers having their pros and cons (the last power comes in too late for it to even be considered useful), but they all have their own style/flair/abilites/core traversal moves, Smoke/Neon being my favorite.    The game is also really pretty to look at, even though it may not be the most colorful game ever, its lighting, contrast, and saturation all blend beautifully, and the game never leaves its steady 30 frames.  But I like I said before, the story isn't perfect.  The voice acting is really well done, and the chemistry between characters is good, but the story is far too simple.  It tries to be grandiose in its simplicity, but fails.  The story isn't much with different (Good/Evil) moralities besides a few scenes that don't offer much, and sometimes the scenes will be exactly the same.  The side objectives really aren't that great either.  There a few cool (though overly simplistic) ones such as spray painting graffiti with the PS4 Controller Touch Pad which was a nice break from the combat, but most are hunting some guy down in a crowd, or finding an audio log and cameras which are all too simple.

This might have been ok but the game inexplicably suffers input lag that can vary from moment to moment and match to match. You can see this yourself by going into practice and executing the same combos repeatedly. They'll execute as expected maybe two thirds of the time while the other third, it just doesn't properly register."], ["PrimeSpeaker", "User", "0", "An alright fighting game but with way too many issues to recommend to anyone.

I know im not obligated to buy all the DLCs, if I dont want to. But in such a case, I would be playing 75% of the game. Because thats what fighting games are all about, characters and move sets. I dont think its acceptable for a game, especially a fighting game, to cost 1/3rd of the price of the console, and thats not even the Collectors Edition, just the full game. On top of that there are equipment items for the characters, equipment items that actually affect gameplay, that are available only through online play, guild ranking and lots of grind. Or they can be bought from the \"Pay to win\" shop in the game, for real cash. Really? So what happened to the \"We want to make the fighting genre popular again\"? Make it a MOBA? Yet MOBAs are completely free, and everything in them can be obtained through grinding. Fighting games are about sitting down with a friend and beating each other, thats when they were popular. This game is the complete opposite, online only equipment, pay to win equipment, lots of DLC, lots of milking the cash cows. Once the cash cows buy everything from the \"Pay to win online shop\", the game will be dead in the water, and the full version will be available for 15 bucks. Injustice 2 is not about fighting, its about cash, buying forgetful stuff, and moving to the next cash cow game. So vote not only on metacritic, vote with your wallets.

It is a sequel to the first game, Injustice: Gods Among Us, and it continues with the conflict between Batman and Superman on their morals. The main goal of the developers was to finish off the storyline of this game in which Batman believes that everyone deserves the right to live, even the worst criminals, whereas Superman believes that their enemies should be killed in order to prevent further troubles from them. They were successful in this as the game ended with the player choosing either Batman or Superman in the end, and their selection alters the ending of the game. If the player chooses Batman, the game ends with Batman defeating Superman and sending him to an alternate universe. If the player selects Superman, however, Batman will be defeated, but Superman will not kill him, as he finds Batman useful, and he instead turns Batman into one of his minions. The graphics of this game remain similar to the first game as they are both realistic looking, but at the same time, it is easy to point out that it is in fact a video game. They help the player feel more immersed in the story because of its realistic qualities. The music and sound effects also help with this, as the music is intense to match the battling and the sound effects are equally intense in order to convey the aggressive qualities of the fighting. The control scheme is partially difficult to memorize, but this is only because the many characters to choose from each work differently and therefore have different combo attacks. They can be difficult to memorize for multiple players, but once learned, they turn out to be not as difficult as they seem. As for camera placement, the view of the player is from the side, and it shows both fighters equally. It pans out when there is distance between them, and it zooms in when the two are close in order to accomodate for the distance. It is effective in keeping interest up because it is not a fixed camera. It moves when it needs to, and this makes it very well made mechanic. Out of 5 stars, I would rate this game 5 stars because of its great mechanics, vast character selection, and well made DLC content.

I liked the technical side of things, almost an absence of loading screens is a nice touch, as the game in story mode flows seamlessly, cut scenes are shifting to gameplay and back without any loading at all, which feels like a blessing after experiencing the hell of all loading screens on PS4 called Bloodborne. Online PVP worked surprisingly smoothly without any lag and what I liked as an addition are interactive arenas that you can use to your advantage.

The game also comes with all the DLC skins so you have a lot of different looks for each hero and villian. I found myself experimenting with each skin because they are so interesting variety-wise. But the main single-player portion of the game is the story. The story basically explains what would happen if Superman lost his s*** due to him being drugged by the Joker, forcing him to kill his own family. He then straight up murders the Joker! This shocked me because Superman would never do this, but he did. We soon find out that those events happened in a parallel dimension, and the heroes and villians from the other dimension get transported when Joker is about to nuke the city of Metropolis. From then on it is your job to stop Superman's evil dictatorship which was caused by him losing everyone he cared about. The story is easily the strongest part of the game.

The graphics are below average for a PS4  game. The cut scenes look awful like I was playing DC Universe Online it's that bad! Next the controls are bad and they expect you to use both the analog sticks and D-Pad if you wan't to pull of cool moves. The controls are made so that if you hit the right stick forward or backward you can move up or back however they did a terrible job implementing this, making it often you have to be lucky or press really hard and fast to actually move up with the joystick. Course the D-Pad works perfectly but if you want to jump in the air you can only use the joystick so forcing you to either play one way or the other while missing out on some mechanics or struggle to use them all by using both the joysticks and D-Pad eliminating the purpose of any strategic movement and just makes you want to stop playing the game and frustrating yourself.  The idea of superheroes and vilians fighting each other is poorly implemented into the game also as most characters have short moves that are a hassle to preform and by the time your about to you get meter-burned and knocked out by your opponent. The game makes it that your punches are incredibly weak and eventually will get slower. They made the game so kid friendly and non violent but characters are repetitive having only 1 basic intro. 1 super move, and that's pretty much it. Voice acting took little our no effort in this game as many of the characters sound like Warner Bros decided to hire the cheapest people for that role. Superman is too overpowered and is always the final boss at the end of arcade mode the start ot the fight is lazy and is just three soldiers trying to apprehend you until superman arrives, than the final cut scene is no more than pictures played with narration .

Inside does almost everything right.  The dystopian world that Playdead has constructed is filled with mostly danger, but also beauty and wonder at times. All of the hard work the team has put forth is incredibly evident.  Whether it's the meticulously crafted set pieces, or the refraction of a flashlight peering through the environment, it's all wonderful. This game is marketed as a puzzle-platformer, but in almost every instance, the puzzles don't feel like puzzles at all. They are overcome with realistic, logical solutions that will only occasionally slow down the player pressing onward, and the game is better for it.  The atmosphere is terrific, and the linear nature is perfect for the $20 price tag. The game is on the short side, which is to be expected for this type of indie game, although it's intrinsically worth much more based on the quality of the product.  After my third play through, I can say it was $20 very well spent. Technically, the game is almost flawless. During my second play through I noticed one instance of clipping, but it's hardly distracting, and doesn't affect the gameplay in any way. The frame rate is rock solid too. My only criticism is the way the music is implemented, or rather are not implemented during certain moments. There are a few instances I thought music could have added to the tension or subtlety of what was happening on screen.  It's really the only thing keeping it away from being an absolute masterpiece.

It's not the best game I've played this year (Dark Souls 3), but I will remember it for a long time. Being the sequel to LIMBO, I had really high expectations for INSIDE. Well I have no doubt in my mind that this game lived up to all of them. The story is really well done even when there's not a hint of dialogue present in the game. This sounds weird on paper, but the magic is in the theories that I'm still thinking about to this day. The game also has a beautiful art style. LIMBO had a black and white filter to the entire game, but the color palette in INSIDE reminds me more of Sin City, how only certain parts of the world are colored. So how is the gameplay? Well, it's surprisingly awesome. I heard someone complain that the game feels like it plays itself. In certain parts of the game, this is true. However, most of the game is filled with well-crafted puzzles and challenges that had me scratching my head more than once. The physics help elevate the challenge and intrigue of some of these, which not many platformers take advantage of nowadays. Despite what I've talked about so far, nothing compares to the ending. It's phenomenal. Probably one of the best I've ever seen in a video game. The events that take place in the finale of INSIDE are too good to spoil, and you need to play the game for yourself to see how amazing it is. The only complaint I have about INSIDE is that even with the added bonus of going back and obtaining the secret ending, INSIDE is very short, only lasting about 3 hours long.

All it will take is a single dungeon before it has wormed its way into your heart."], ["Games Master UK", "Critic", "79", "Good, sometimes, great, adventuring, but 3 should try to move further from Zelda's duller tropes. [Jan 2016, p.75]"], ["ZTGD", "Critic", "75", "Ittle Dew 2 is actually a decently paced and pretty fun action adventure game. The controls never ruined the experience for me, and with the amount to see and do and the ease of use the entire game can be, I feel like anyone who grew up playing classic Zelda games will enjoy this one enough to see it through to the end. Just remember, it is more on the simpler side. At the same time, I feel like this may be a bit of a short experience for some epically for the $20 price point."], ["PlayStation Country", "Critic", "70", "It\u2019s an unashamed Zelda clone but this one certainly flatters. It takes what it needs from Nintendo\u2019s franchise whilst refining on key aspects. You might tire of the block and switch puzzles but the game packs a brief length with plenty of exploration. The dungeon bosses provide ample challenge for those wanting it. If you\u2019re after a quick fix, this might be for you."], ["Hardcore Gamer", "Critic", "70", "What the game lacks in depth, it almost completely makes up for in sheer fun \u2014 but it is a flawed experience to be sure. Those seeking something Zelda-esque will be left satisfied, but not blown away by the experience."], ["Digitally Downloaded", "Critic", "60", "Ittle Dew 2 has many good things going for it, but I am wondering whether Ittle might thrive more now if she sets off on her raft, unencumbered by trying to be part of another franchise's tradition, to discover a new land all her own."]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "Switch", "Xbox One"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/54d492014fb282b2e57be9bad8849cfd.jpg"}
