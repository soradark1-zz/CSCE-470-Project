When I saw that this game has a user score of 1.6 i was surprised. I know that it's not a 10 or even a 9 for that matter, but 1.6 is too low. Like many of the reviewers, i got it as a free ps plus game and I honestly enjoyed it. equal in quality to its gorgeous art style, the gameplay is actually fun and original, it takes a little while to understand the controls but once you understand them, you'll enjoy it and you'll be playing without even thinking. It clicks and becomes natural especially when you understand the movement of the character and the glowing ball that teleports you. The story is nothing special,it's a short game but it has a great replay value since your progress through the levels is timed which means that you can compete with friends or even with people around the world for the best time for each level. The menu is beautiful aesthetically, but practically,it's a mess. It is difficult to know which level you've selected because ,to my understanding, the circle that emits the least amount of light is the one that is selected.The difference in glow is barely visible which makes the menu unclear and to be frank the worst part of the game. The boss levels,on the other hand, are amusing and sometimes frustrating but that's part of the fun. I like that when you loss during the boss levels, it doesn't start you from the beginning, only from the last beaten sub-level(after going through and beating the glowing circles surrounding the boss).To be honest this  is an amazing game and it's not getting the credit it deserves.

Great art style. Its frustrating due to terrible control scheme. Movement is overcomplicated and super finnicky. Getting around involves shooting a ball, dashing in air, and teleporting. For no apparent reason you cant bind buttons to any of main buttons such as X for jump, you have to use the L and R buttons (huh?). What sort of game wont let you use X as jump when it has no other use for the button. This also makes the platforming unnecesarily annoying. To get around and avoid stuff you have to first aim this ball, then make sure you teleport at the right time. Hell even to hurt guys you cant just shoot, jump, or attack....no you have to aim and shoot the ball at them and then when it is exactly on them you have to teleport. I cannot count the number of times i teleported a second too soon or late or the bad aiming from the joystick was off. How could they screw up attacking in a platformer. Then you have to spend most of the time aiming this tiny little ball through little crevices and while falling to your death, forcing countless unneeded repetition. So much of the game is forced repetition and trial and error by bad control and level design. That is the artificial type of \"hard\" you dont want. Also every hazard and enemy is 1 hit kill basically, meaning if you are off you die and need to start again. Thankfully there are numerous checkpoints. Whats annoying is the air dash is a set distance. So for getting around if your aim is off or teleport wrong time, many times air dash will overshoot the platform or the hazard you are trying to skirt around. This makes platforming and getting around extra imprecise and annoying."], ["drlowdon", "User", "3", "The more I played Aaru's Awakening the lower I wanted to mark it as this is one of those indie titles with an interesting concept and a number of good ideas that is let down badly, and I mean badly, in its execution.

This game kind of transcends the medium, I believe.  It's not a game, not in the traditional sense anyway.  It's more of an experience simulator.  One with gorgeous visuals, a sublime soundtrack and one of the most smooth and elegant control schemes I've encountered.  It's a mechanically simple and direct setup, without the need to explain anything via menus or on screen text.  In fact, there no HUD item of any kind, no map or marks, not even a health bar.  You can't die or really get \"hurt\".  You don't know where this world comes from or what it means.  It's an undersea dream world though.

At just 3-4 hours of general playtime I still believe it's worth every penny of that.  Another advantage it has going for it is that literally almost anyone capable of moving a joystick and holding a button down could play this and get something out of it.  Only negative I could mark on it would be it's shortness, but again for the price it was worth more than that.  I definitely wanted to see more creatures and see how far I would go down the rabbit hole.  I also want to praise the graphics and art direction more specifically.  There is a great balance between realism and game world here.  In that I mean it's not trying to portray a true ecological version of the sea, but the aesthetic is very much intact.  Replayability, yeah you could definitely play through this a second time and probably find some of the items you missed on the first run.  It is a fairly linear game in that you're moving from one clearly definable area (sometimes smaller and sometimes enormous) to another.  Within these areas you have the general freedom to move wherever you like and explore off the beaten path, but there's always a very simple mechanic upon which to progress, so you can't really go around the level design in that way.  If you care about this sort of thing, there's a pretty wide variety of sea life to be found and they're all rendered very well and glide through the water convincingly.  The giant schools of smaller fish swarming in a cyclone is something to be seen.  With the excellent ambient soundtrack to boot, I can't recommended this one enough.

Is this game as good as journey? no, but it has a lot going for it still. The game is absolutely beautiful when it comes to its art design and game physics, possibly one of the most beautiful games I have ever played visual wise. The game mechanics work well but are way to simplistic and I wish they would have implemented more ways to make your way through the game instead of just swimming. The \"puzzles\" are way to simple as well, not that I expected the puzzles to really challenge me, but I did want them to be fun atleast, and they just weren't.

I might sound kind of negative towards this game, but I actually really enjoyed it while I was playing and was extremely immersed in the visuals and sound design of the game. I really enjoyed the mechanics and how they felt even if they were overly simplistic, and there definitely some emotional moments in the game, but it didn't leave me with anything to really remember by or take away from it besides it beautiful design, which was quite disappointing for a game that is so well made in almost every aspect.

My biggest complaint of this game is the same i had with Lost Song and it is when you are forced to fly and fight at the same time. While this idea in theory seems amazing the execution is horrible especially when the game pulls the camera back so far that you are unable to tell how close to the enemy that you are so you end up missing your attacks entirely. Enemies have cheap moves that will easily trap you on the ground where before you have a chance to get up they will have killed you. If you are hit once in the sky you immediately fall to ground while still vulnerable to being attacked with nothing you can do other then watch. Besides all of the issues with combat this game is just a copy and paste of Lost Song with a few new thing inserted when it comes to map designs. The weapon selection is pretty lacking at least from what i can tell and the graphics are pretty outdated. Personally I would stay away from this game due to the many problems this one has.

The characters, while having pretty good designs, are mostly stereotypes of stereotypes that aren't worth caring for, especially since they cant stop shouting meta jokes and slangs, even during dungeon exploration (Pinkun is the worst offender). Some people might like it but for me, it was just a cringe fest. Not to mention these dialogue cut scenes lasts way too long (there aren't even dialogue choices, which is something every RPGs needs to have). Because of this, I ended up  skipping most of the dialogues. The story is okay for the most part but it builds up way too slow when it shouldn't and I just wasn't invested very much. Akihabara feels and looks soulless compared to the on in Akiba's Trip. There are few citizens in different colors with no faces to add a bit of life but it just fails because a lot of these just repeat the same animation, not doing much. All you do there is just run around, talk with story related NPCs and buy stuff. No mini-games, no interactions, nothing. Hell, most of Akihabara's iconic places are replaced with fake dumb names probably due to copyright. You can buy equipment in the form of clothing and accessories in item shops (and by shops I meant item menus) but they just mostly sell the same stuff as always. There are few upgrades for your melee weapons but there isn't a lot of purchasable weapons. And the costumes in the game are mostly DLCs.

Just what I was looking for in a horror genre. I would get desperate to find a save point before getting attacked by the Alien."], ["Kikuchiyo", "User", "9", "Finally an Alien game worthy of the name and the license.  Rarely have I been so tense playing a video game.  The atmosphere is spot on from the original film and completely immersive.  Periods of atmosphere followed by nail biting moments were you cower under a table as the alien stalks you, your breath in your throat as it skulks about your hiding spot.  This is not a game for the faint of heart or for those without patience.  If you hurry, you will die, if you don't choose your moments carefully, you will die, if you don't plan ahead walking into encounters you will die.  And even if you do everything right the unpredictable nature of the AI may still turn around at the most inopportune moment and you will die.  Many complaints about the game are that there are limited save points coupled with long stretches of frustrating deaths to reach the next.  Contrary to nay-sayers there are actually plenty of save points along the way.  The challenge is reaching them undetected long enough to save.  That is part of what makes this game great.  It is merciless, hard and unforgiving.  That unto itself is part of the horror.  Knowing that you have played for an hour or more of progress with that save spot just next door and you being desperate to reach it.  However, the alien is skulking and hissing around it, or about you in your hiding spot hampering your ability to reach it.  Or upon reaching that save point you screaming at the screen to \u201churry up and save\u201d as Ripley punches in the 3 second code necessary to save your progress before being spotted.  However, as scary as the game is we all know that it is just a game and our real lives are not on the line as the creature devours your face time and time again.  So how to simulate that same tension level in a gamer sitting in their cushy living room couch in \u201cEverytown\u201d USA?  Make it so that you have something to risk and not just the virtual life of Amanda Ripley on your big screen TV.  Make it so it has something tangible to you, something every gamer fears\u2026lost progress.  Not only are you afraid of the alien lurking about with crescendoing horror music blaring through your speakers, but of also losing your precious effort and game time to reach that next objective.  Yes you will die, yes you cry out as you lose an hour or more of progress.  And it will happen often.  Unlike CoD you will not respawn were you left off ready to frag another player a half block away from your derezzing corpse.  This is not CoD and if you are a gamer that likes that genre and expect that type of gameplay from a horror game than this is not the game for you.  This is about heightened stress and terror and the developers have made it to be as such.  You on the edge of your seat through this ride and if it was an easy go there would be a flurry of complaints that the game is too simplistic and over and done with too quickly.  On the contrary, every objective here seems an accomplishment, every save point a victory.  I found that after hitting a save I would regularly slump back into my chair sometimes mentally and emotionally drained from an hour long Epinephrine rush.  Pausing the game to catch ones breath is a luxury that Amanda Ripley wouldn't enjoy in that virtual world being stalked by one of the deadliest creatures in the galaxy.  A real challenge would be to be to eliminate the ability to pause and to keep that tension going to experience how the character would truly feel in that situation.  Complaints about the scripting of the alien AI are bogus.  There few sections where the alien is scripted to appear at story driven segments as it is dropped into a level with you or to force a particular plot point.  Beyond that the AI is brilliant, unpredictable and adaptive.  Every encounter feels unique as it moves and hunts in seemly random patterns.  It will stalk a circle of rooms or halls 3 times only to suddenly jump into a vent or reverse direction catching you in mid stride when you think you have it figured out.  You will pat yourself on the back for outsmarting and ditching the blasted thing 2 rooms back only to have it drop out from an overhead vent in front you, sending you scurrying for cover.  Overall the game has delivered what it promised, a tense horror game from one of the great movie franchises in Sci-Fi history.  It is tribute to the original material and worthy of Ridley Scott's vision and the roots of the series.  Top that off with DLC from the movie it is a must for any Alien fan.    Hopefully the remaining DLC still to come will add more levels from some of the other films.  Would love to see a scene from Alien 3 with the dog alien bounding down a prison vent shaft toward you.  Turn off the lights, crank the volume on the surround sound, make some popcorn, and be prepared to bite your nails and fire off a curse word or three.

The level design is pristine and makes you feel as if you're actually in the 1970's - 80's Alien films. The Xenomorph is equally well designed and truly terrifying. Since the majority of its movement is randomized, you never know when he'll show up and how to deal with / track his movements. It's truly unnerving. Whats more, it can be a lot of fun to use it to your advantage as well. There's nothing like approaching a group of humans, popping one with the revolver, waiting for the Xenomorph to investigate, and allowing it to annihilate your enemies for you. That is of course, if it doesn't annihilate you as well. The Working Joes (androids) can be equally as horrifying as well. Without knowing what to look for, you never know if it will be friendly or hostile and if it decides to be hostile it can be just as frustrating, albeit rewarding, to get away from them as it is the alien. To the credit of the lower scoring reviewers out there, it can get frustrating having to replay certain levels time and time again until you get your movements just right. It can be even more frustrating to think you're hiding safely away in a locker only for the Xenomorph to find you, or that you're killed just before you reach the \"holy grail\" - save point but I think this works in favor of the game.

It does a great job of presenting a strong survival horror atmosphere by making the player feel constantly under-equipped, overwhelmed, and sometimes out numbered. And, to the game's credit, there are transcendent moments of heart-pounding tension and relief. However, that tension quickly turns to tedium and frustration. The name of the game here is stealth, but there are no mechanics here to help. The first time you get grabbed by your stalker, the xenomorph, it's startling. Maybe even the second and third. By the fourth or fifth, it'll become annoying. It would seem that the perfect hunting machine is a little too perfect, seemingly having ESP or a Lojack chip implanted in your character, so it can sniff you out no matter where you are, how little your moving, or how quiet you're being. Couple this with a ridiculous and archaic checkpointing system, this game is not for those with less-than-saintly patience. The story is flat and degrades to Ripley running errands for her worthless comrades, and the game runs far, far, far too long, probably clocking somewhere between 15 and 20 hours for first-time completion.

Alien: Isolation is one of the best horror games I have ever played. The game is not perfect and suffers from a few flaws but is overall an excellent experience that should not be missed by fans of the survival horror genre and fans of the original Alien film. Alien: Isolation is the first real AAA horror game to have come out in years that focuses on pure horror over constant combat and empowerment. Alien: Isolation breaks the convention of traditional horror games by including less combat than even the original masters of survival horror such as the Resident Evil and Silent Hill franchises. The graphics are stunningly detailed and look almost photo-realistic at times. The fog and light effects are impeccably designed and really help add to the game\u2019s amazing atmosphere. The alien model is well designed and so are its animations which really help intimidate the player. The setting of the game Sevastopol is well designed and full of detail that makes it look truly lived in and real. I found the character models in the game especially corpses looking wonky compared to the game\u2019s detailed setting. The lip syncing is also bad during cutscenes and in gameplay. Luckily they are not a lot of human characters in the game so this did take that much away from the experience. The excellent lighting makes up with this issue times making the character models look better. The androids that chase you out throughout the station are excellently designed as cheap knock offs of the ones in the films. The sound design is first-rate and really adds to the games uncomfortable claustrophobic atmosphere. The noise on the 80\u2019s tech is loud and booming and so is the score. The noises the Alien\u2019s makes are quite horrifying from the thud of its clompy feet to the heavy breathing of the alien and pounding of your character\u2019s heart make the atmosphere thickly repulsive. Alien: Isolation tells a good narrative that stays true to the original movie but suffers from some pacing problems. The game stars Amanda Ripley the daughter of the protagonist of first movie Ellen Ripley. I recommend that it is best to see the original film before playing this game because the narrative expects that most players have seen the movie at times. The narrative is slow paced just like the original film. The game does not suffer from the same ludonarrative dissonance that a lot games suffer from where there is a conflict between the story and gameplay. Amanda Ripley is a simple engineer and is not a powerful fighter and there is next to no combat in the game to tell that story accurately. I enjoyed every minute of the game but I felt the story was too long and drawn out than was necessary and had a bad cliffhanger ending. I found the gameplay focus on evasion over combat an excellent design choice. Alien: Isolation decides to give the player some weapons including a pistol and shotgun for androids and human enemies but are best not used at all because they often attract the alien which can one hit kill you. To stay true to your character most of the gameplay consists of doing repair work to the station to find a way off. The game has hacking mini games for unlocking doors and computer terminals and superb crafting system. The beginning is tense and only introduces the alien only a few hours in than having it appear right at the beginning. Encounters with the alien are tense and uncomfortable and make the player feel vulnerable due to the Alien\u2019s advanced A.I. The game uses a checkpoint save system where players go to phone booths to save which added to the game\u2019s tension. The player is given a motion tracker that can track the alien and enemies in the area which makes encounters even more horrifying. I liked that the game has many difficulty selections for the player to choose. The Alien can be cheap sometimes. Later in the game a flamethrower is introduced that cannot kill the alien but if used can scare it away which balances the difficulty. The human A.I. on the other hand is extremely dumb. The humans in the game seem to have no self preservation skills and summon the alien killing them and you. The androids which I found at first creepy slowly became a nuisance throughout my playthrough and will often grab and stun the player forcing the player into a QTE event. The game at one point skid the line of ludonarrative desidense by throwing a few hordes of androids at the player. One complaint people have told me about the game is the backtracking which I did not mind because it made me feel familiar with the station and allowed me to see the changes I have caused to the station. Alien: Isolation is an overall excellent game. The game has a few flaws that hold it back but Alien: Isolation\u2019s model for survival horror should be used by all horror games coming out in the future."], ["mash27", "User", "10", "This game is a masterpiece of atmosphere, immersion and tension.

Not only does this game have horrific performance issues (anyone who says they get no lags or freezes is lying), but the game itself is just...bad. The UI is buggy and tedious to manage. There is absolutely NO tutorial of any kind, the Dino's rarely work as intended, and even if you manage to learn the games ridiculous controls and get a foothold in a server, you WILL be killed and raided by one of the few \"Alpha\" tribes just for **** and giggles. Do not bother joining any official server considering they are all EXTREMELY unbalanced, not to mention toxic. Even unofficial servers are mostly terrible, what with the inconsistent admins, hackers, unbalanced gameplay, and constant NAT issues.

This has lead to multiple servers with very few people as one tribe just patrols around and destroys any fresh bases and run people from the server. I moved to at least 5-6 servers and found the same issue. On one server we found the perfect base location (4 of us). Built a huge stone wall, Behemoth gate, defences and even a frabicator over time. We had tamed multiple dino's but in the end it meant nothing. A bunch of high levels brought there 200+ Pteradons, flew over the wall and destroyed literally everything.

And it isn't that much of a scary game, i wouldn't call it horror, but a thriller. While it doesn't clearly contain much danger or disturbing imagery, there are moments that legitimately made me feel scared, and the voice-acting and sound effects are great. It contains a superb soundtrack, and an intresting but overall mysterious premise of our surroundings. We can barely know the universe we are in, but we know that people can have fake memories implanted into their brain, and things as such, it all feels very mysterious and intresting, but it's all usually up to interpretation. I really liked the ending, but it was rather confusing. While i enjoyed all the things about the premise, storyline, ambientation, universe, voice-acting, graphics, sound-effects, atmosphere, but there is one problem which is what overall pushes me away from this game. The puzzles. As smart as they are, they're overall annoying. They feel insanely annoying, and you'll be stuck in many parts of the game, While it forms a great mystery and suspense, once you look back, there is only one moment that truly makes you feel uncomfortable and frightened. From what i said, it seems good, right? Well, yeah. It is very good in my perspective, but what the game actually shows you overall creates a lack of emotion that you develop for the game. When you look back, it's overall truly amazing, but when you look more into it, it's not really as amazing as it seems. There isn't much that the game offers, but even as mind-bending the story is, the information you actually get in the game makes it seem underwhelming and not as good as it seems. It truly is amazing, but when you play it, it's not that amazing, but it will be once you look back into it. The biggest problem here is the lack of information, and at a first playthrough, it'll be infested with annoying, but smart puzzles, and it may seem really bad. But overall, once you look back into it, Asemblance is a mind-bending psychological mystery thriller, one that brings you not as much fear or thrill, but the eerie atmosphere and moments of the game overall make you feel uncomfortable. The storyline, is truly amazing, but in the game, it's not so amazing, as of the lack of information, but by looking back into it, it is amazing. There isn't much left for me to say, but i overall give Asemblance a 4.5/10. It's not really worth it, and it's not bad, the storyline and everything is surely mind-bending and smart, aswell as mysterious and somehow emotional and intresting, but when you actually play it, it's not really that good.

Because Brotherhood only introduced 1 new thing, summoning assassin's, Revelations is probably my least favorite. In every game that followed AC2 they gave us maybe 1 new thing to do or weapon to attack and then took something else away. In AC3 everything changed, Connor's running/jumping/crawling style is the same as Edwards. The Tomahawk was badass my favorite. The 2 swords Edward has are the only thing different from Connor. He's basically Connor, just with plastic surgery and 2 swords. The graphics are really great, i have to say that. But overall it just isn't anything we haven't seen before, even the main story.

The controls are good, really good graphics, a great looking open world. But, other than that it really isn't that much different from AC3. I personally think that AC3 was more innovative in it's overall gameplay experience. It deferred much from the other AC games in style and combat. There we was also first introduced to sailing ships, although it's much more developed in AC4 and much more a part of the game than AC3. AC4's style is almost identical to AC3 (like running, walking, crawling, jumping etc.), the combat is also almost the same (like the special movies where you kill 2 opponents at a time with your pistols or rope darts), the combat style is a little different because obviously we now have 2 weapons at the same time, but not as cool or fluent as Connor's axe (that is my favorite AC weapon of all time). Ubisoft really got lazy with this one, also there's not much variety in the gameplay (like sailing all over the world which is freakin' huge looking for animus fragments and chests is really boring after a while and painfully repetitive) and the lack of different weapons you can buy like Ezio's many gadgets (grenades etc.) 2 handed weapons (which you can get in this game, but only from the guards). And i really think it's boring that you can get the most damaging sword in a matter of hours as damage levels are only as high as 5. There really isn't much of a challenge in the AC games, i really miss a difficulty level you can choose from. Enemies are easily overcome even if there's 20 surrounding you. And the story is like any other AC game. It's overall repetitive and certainly not improved that much from the other games. This game is way too easy, and incredibly overrated. AC3 is much better. I really don't understand how so many people can think this is far superior to AC3, and think AC3 is the worst entry in the series (Revelations anyone?), maybe it's the nostalgia from the Ezio games and you just thought all other characters and settings that came after, no matter how great, was complete a** in comparison. I really hope that AC Unity will come up with many new things and ideas, because if this, repeating everything from the previous games over and over again, continues i'm done with this series. I love the AC series, i played the first one when it came out and have now played all games (except for the dlc add-ons) and praise them for the style and gameplay. But ever since AC Brotherhood (because of the summoning Assassin's to help you) i really don't think the games have come up with anything new.

Its not worth paying extra. I found this out when I sank a ship, and it sank right through my ship. Also the graphics are just above average. Kenway's face moved like it was stuck in a irritating smirk. I found when I killed an enemy they fly a foot forwards when they have been struck by my hideously overpowered swords. Halfway through the game I knew none of my enemy's stood a chance against me when I gained two swords, four pistols, a dart shooter, two hidden blades, smoke bombs, throwing knives and money. All challenge was removed from the game at this point even when I wasn't even trying to accomplish anything. The story missions are the more repetitive than the resident evil series. Nearly all of them require you to tail or eavesdrop on the enemy. They are so easy I was just running on rooftops try to keep up with them. But one thing I noticed, WHERE ARE THE ASSASSINATION MISSIONS? They should have just called this game 'Pirates Creed'. There are only about three in the entire game. It trys to cover this up by having assassins side missions. These only require you to kill a target to get 1000 Reales. There can be a 500 bonus if you stay out of combat. This can be so easy, when I got the berserk darts I was trying to get my target killed by his guards. Sailing is fun as it gets with trying to get cargo from other ships to either sell or use to upgrade your ship. I tried to ignore the ships level, and just see how long it took for the ship to move another way other than the way I was going. Eventually we were just going in circles. Don't bother trying to board a ship unless you want to lower your wanted level or want to send it to 'Kenway's Fleet'. You still get the ships loot regardless of how you destroy it. Kenways fleet is just a small and unnecessary add-on to the game. Its just another way to get more money. The characters are boring and all have a similar personality. They all seem to be okay with Kenway risking his life for their gain. The franchise has got better since the disappointing third installment.

I played this game for the first time today and I can't believe what I've been missing! I've never been truly invested in the Assassin's Creed franchise. I played a few of the old games: Assassins Creed 2 and a bit of Revelations. Assassins Creed 2 was fun at times and the graphics were amazing for it's time but I didn't enjoy it as much as I felt I should have done. The controls were sometimes uncomfortable and both the stealth and the parkour mechanics felt clunky. What's more, the game got rather repetitive and tedious half way through and I never finished it because of this. Assassins Creed Black Flag fixes all of those issues. The controls have been significantly improved so you're only holding down the R2 button instead of R2 and X, and you can now jump. The free running mechanics feel somewhat more fluid and there's much less frustratingly jumping off of tall buildings to your death. Stealth has also been added to, though it's admittedly still not excellent. What makes this game excellent, though, in my opinion is the epic naval battles. I cannot begin to describe how cool these are! There's so much fun to be had in fighting against enemy ships and then boarding them, assassinating the crew and looting their goods. I haven't been able to go back to Assassins Creed 2 because I don't want to play another Assassins Creed that doesn't have this awesome naval combat. Though I consider the sailing and naval battles to be the meat of the game I also had a ton of fun with the other traditional Assassins Creed activities, mostly consisting of finding collectables and climbing to viewpoints. Exploration is heavily rewarded in this game and it has a huge open world that I know will take me a while to fully explore! Finally the story in Assassins Creed Black Flag is great. It is perhaps less engaging than Assassins Creed 2's story but nevertheless has a variety of interesting characters and good writing. If you haven't played this game, pick it up.

At least they toned down the number of enemies on the rooftops so that you can move through town without setting off a hornet's nest. Overall, when movements are performed flawlessly, it looks great. As far as the overall graphics, it's the best so far being in 1080p with no frame drops. The open world is the biggest, without being bored to tears, as you have fast travel, plenty of ships to meet an plunder, or castaways to save and islands to explore.

Everything about is is fun. From plundering unsuspecting ships, to jumping from rooftop to rooftop, taking out your assassin contracts. The sailing mechanics in this game are easily the best out there. Why? Because its simple and straightforward. The handling you have over your ship is completely determined by how fast your going, if you are just prowling the waters at a slow pace, you will have precision control over where you turn. But if your just sailing away at full speed, you will find yourself turning right, then left, then a little more right, and the a little left again to get to the trajectory you want to be at. Fighting other ships is another big part of the game. There are so many ways enemy ships will try and sink you, and so many defensive strategies you will need to develop. Smaller ships will try and shoot you down from an angel where you can't shoot them, where bigger ships will just try and ram into you at full speed. There are many ways to play as a pirate, and i guarantee you will enjoy all of them. One of the only complaints I have about this game is the voice acting. It just never seems to be right. The voices will often times merge to the point where you won't be able to hear who's talking, sometimes you will need to strain to hear the characters talk over the crash of waves, and other times there voices will come booming through your television way louder than usual. This, however, does not deteriorate from the actual game play at all. The combat is still balanced, with swords, pistols, and poisoned darts that you can use to overcome your enemies, and awesome stealthy assassinations that you can perform to take a single person out quietly.

Who is a far better, interesting and stronger character than Conor from Assassin's Creed III. Set in the early 18th century Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy and follows the notorious Kenway, grandfather of Conor, who becomes embroiled in conflict waged between the Assassin's and Templars. Gameplay has never been an issue. It's the fact it's become so repetitive and dull and thankfully the introduction of ship based exploring that's all changed. Allowing you to sail is a great addition to the franchise. You already know what your getting from the combat, melee system so there's no change. The setting makes the difference.

Nevertheless, AC IV was my top choice for a PS4 launch title. From the moment I washed up on the game's first island, I instantly found this version more compelling. The new protagonist, Edward Kenway, lives some time before Connor. He's a pirate, rather than an assassin, and a slightly unsavory character. He's convinced he can make his fortune, chasing one far-fetching dream after another. He's more interesting than either protagonist from AC3, but more over, the game is just more fun. The scenes are broken down into a number of small locations, and when you get everything in one, it turns gold on your map. Which basically meant I ran around trying to turn as many locations gold as possible. For the first time in a long, long time, I found myself interested in accomplishing everything in game.

The main story is alright; nothing special but not terrible either, which isn't a bad thing since most people will probably enjoy exploring and naval battles more anyways. The only few problems I had were with the parkour system. Having played both inFamous games I was interested in seeing how it works in Assassin's Creed. The system works, but it is flawed.

The story in this game was nothing special. You play as Edward Kenway, a pirate trying to become rich. I thought Edward Kenway was an interesting character, but all the other characters in this game are forgettable. For example some of the characters you meet in this game will die and when it happens you really don\u2019t care as much you should, which hurts the impact of the story overall.

But in the next couple dozen hours of my experience, I actually came out not only surprised, but deeply impressed by the well crafted story-line, main and supporting characters, and even villains. And while the ship mechanic had been used on the third game, Ubisoft definitely improved and worked hard to make it the best part of the game; Edward's Ship (The Jackdaw) feels like another character, and with the amount of time you spend on it, it doesn't end up boring or repetitive. Also the number of activities you can do in the game is very impressive and varied, and it allows you to not get too tired of them in the time playing the game. Also on the good side, the excellent score by Brian Tyler, that really makes you get into the pirate theme, and I have played it outside  the game the second most of a pirate music outside the First Pirates of the Caribbean Movie. On the bad side, the main combat mechanics of the game, while fun and good in whole, are not very improved from previous games and the new gadgets, while cool, do not change to much in the aspect of how you played from previous games. Also other stuff carried from previous games not improved like some glitches while climbing and the like, and the sometimes hilariously dumb AI, especially in covert missions. But all in all, a great experience that lefts me wanting to see more of the pirates Assassin's and really gets me in the mood and the characters, and probably the best Assassin's game outside  the Assassin's Creed II.

Recent Ubisoft games were filled with boring repetitive side-objectives and stuff to collect without any context. That gave games a little bit of extra padding and added length. But that doesn't mean there's not a lot to do here. There's still a ton of stuff to do here but it all feels meaningful, a little bit like the Witcher 3. Apart from that, ancient Egypt is really stunning and exploring this beautiful world is actually rewarding.

Honestly I wasn't sure what to expect from this game but it certainly wasn't what I got. First off, just like with AC4 this game simply doesn't feel like an Assassin's Creed game and the protagonist never really feels like an assassin. As a fan of the series who has played every installment, I can tell you for a fact that this game feels much more like a cross between Farcry and AC, and this isn't a good thing. If you were hoping to experience dashing across the rooftops of Rome or Venice, like in previous titles, then think again. There is very little in the way of verticality in this game and unlike in AC4 where you had verticality in the wilderness, in ACO you have desert, flat, dead desert. Those who are comparing it to Horizon Zero Dawn are correct, as most \"assassinations\" happen by whistling people over to the tall grass and then assassinating them when prompted. And with the new level system there is no more walk up slowly and assassinate two guards simultaneously with your double hidden blades like in previous titles. Quite frankly, you never really feel like an assassin in this game, but rather a warrior who sometimes murders people quietly. The combat system is also garbage. Granted, the combat system in other AC titles wasn't excellent either, it's just that this also takes huge cues from Horizon ZD, and the leveling system ensures that you will simply be murdered by anyone who is too high level for you restricting where you can go and what you can do in this \"open world.\" On the positive side, the world is definitely the biggest we have ever gotten in an AC game, and the graphics are beautiful. The colors and detail is very vibrant. However, the crafting, leveling, skill points, loot system, and leveling up/looting higher level weapons and gear all feels out of place. I see what they were trying to do, they were trying to expand the AC franchise and what can be done, but I can't help but feel like they could have done it better and in a way that would have felt more like an assassin's creed game instead of assassin's farcry. Honestly everything in this game feels like it is mediocre and rushed. I know Ubisoft took a year off to better polish this game, but honestly for what they were trying to accomplish with this game, it needed at least a 4 year development cycle or more to be able to pull it off, without it feeling cheap like it does. There is some fun here, and the story is. . . decent? Because of this I give it a 4, mediocre at best, and only worth a buy after a couple of price drops. Honestly, you would do better to just go get Horizon ZD if you have a PS4 or just skip this title until it's in the sales bin."], ["BranCoGaming", "User", "5", "Worst AC I every played absolutely not historical, fighting system is crap...5/10"], ["JasonBaureBond", "User", "7", "Grafics and world looks really good.

The game now plays like an open world RPG.

I was so confused because I forgot to set the main quest as active, and was messing around an ol' temple, when I see some dudes. I get ready to pick them off one by one, and just as I get the first one in the head - mind you, there was no indication that this was the main mark; his lvl was just a little higher than the others - the game goes into a cut scene!!!

Bayek is a tormented and flawed medjay. He and his wife are distraught over the death of their son, and their conflict just so happens to coincide with the motivations of Cleopatra as they hunt down targets for her and her group. The plot is very well done in comparison to previous games in the series, and it shows just how innovative it can be despite its many iterations, with or without a terrible blockbuster associating with it. The exploration is truly the most fascinating aspect, as the gameplay is similar in regard to other open-world RPGs like The Witcher 3.

Micro transactions seem to be a common thing in most games these days, but thankfully not participating in them takes nothing away from the game. I've played every Assassins Creed game and enjoyed them all, some more than others. For me at least, this has to be my favourite since Brotherhood. Highly recommended."], ["SeptemberFly", "User", "9", "When I first purchased this game, I was filled with both with both hope and worry. I was worried because in my opinion it has been a long time since there was a good assassins creed game and I didn't want the potential of the great setting and historical to be wasted on another disappointing game in what felt like a dying series. On the other hand, I was hopeful due to the game being developed by the team which made Assassins Creed Black Flag, which in my opinion was the best game in the series. Plus they had an extra year of development on the game which I hoped would help revive the series. Thankfully, the hopeful side of me was rewarded and I was given a great game that is easily up there in terms of quality with Black Flag and the Ezio Trilogy. The game's setting and graphics are both incredibly beautiful. Egypt in this game is enormous and looks fantastic, with many different kinds of environments ranging from vast deserts to lush rainforests. The gameplay is a much needed improvement for the series. The best way I can describe it is a mix of The Witcher 3 and Dark Souls. It has a similar lock on system and fighting styles to the souls series, with different weapon types each having their own unique styles and are suited for different types of ways to fight enemies. The dodging and movement feels very much like The Witcher 3, everything feeling very fluid and natural. The combat isn't the only thing the game borrows from the Witcher, as in a lot of ways it feels more like The Witcher 3 than an assassins creed game. While this might upset some fans of the series, to me it feels like a much needed change of pace. the map and how missions work are the things that are most similar to the witcher. The map consists of various question marks across the map to investigate and each are has a level cap where you probably shouldn't go to unless you are at least 2 or 3 levels behind what it tells you is the recommended level. There are around 60 sidequests in the game, with some of the quality of them being hit or miss. Some are simple fetch quests that aren't super interesting, while others having interesting stories them. As for the story, it is one of the stronger stories in the assassin\u2019s creed series. It is fairly similar to the setup in Assassins Creed 2, with it being about the main character Bayek going on a revenge quest. While the setup itself is nothing really groundbreaking, it is the characters that really propel the story into being one of the more intriguing one\u2019s in the series. Bayek, the protagonist in the story, is very good. He\u2019s family man who suffered a tragedy in said family that sets up his quest for revenge. He has a lot of emotion to him and you really feel for him in the struggle that he is going through. Thankfully, unlike Connor from Assassins Creed 3, he is not completely one note. He is very noble and has a strong sense of morality, who is extremely dedicated to his wife and to helping the people of Egypt. He is charismatic as well, not afraid to crack a joke once in a while and has good chemistry with the characters around him. Thankfully he is not too jokey, because he doesn\u2019t fall into the dashing funnyman rogue archetype that the assassins creed series has overused with many of its characters. Bayek\u2019s wife Aya is also a standout in the story. She is very capable in her own right and is very dedicated to helping people similar to Bayek. The chemistry between Aya and Bayek is great. While they love and are very devoted to each other, both have different opinions on how they should be doing things. This along with the stress of a family tragedy they\u2019ve experienced, provides an interesting subplot to the main story with the characters having trouble trying to coincide the love they feel for one with some disagreements that they have with one another. She often steals the show in the scenes that she appears in, and some individual missions where you get to play as her is a lot of fun. Assassins Creed Origins is a great game and is well rounded in all areas. Hopefully Ubisoft will take the hint and continue to not release these games annually, as in my opinion this has helped the series return to the kind of quality that it used to have."], ["rodericrinehart", "User", "9", "The best Assassin's Creed game by a mile, and maybe the best Ubisoft game.

While it's a step in the right direction I think they took 2 steps back with the implementation of the RPG/ Micro-Transaction elements. This is essientially AC: The Skyrim version. You are forced to skip elements of the game because you're character is too weak to tackle said temple or fort. Where as the old games made you more powerful through acquiring upgrades to equipment but never impeded your progress, here you become stronger simply by collecting XP and anything above your own level is instant death. So simply playing the game using stealth and action is not enough in the new and improved AC. Come across a foe with a read skull of death icon above their head and you better run. It makes no sense whatsoever. I cleared out a temple in an area that had bandits at my level. Not far away I discovered another fort with the same exact generic bandits but you can't stealth kill them for the arbitrary reason that they are at too high a level. Instead they reverse the move and then proceed to one hit insta kill you while your attacks do nothing. Why? Because this generic \"Bandit Leader\" is level 20 but his twin brother you just killed not far away was only level 5. LOL!

The graphics overall are amazing and Ubisoft did a great job at recreating ancient Egypt, the atmosphere is phenomenal and the environment is spectacular and I would definitely recommend that you stop in your tracks and just go around discovering the vast and gorgeous world of AC: Origins. Now let's talk about a couple things that aren't so amazing. The combat is...interesting, it's not perfect, not by a mile. It was a bold decision that the devs made but it didn't pay off entirely, due to the lock on combat system you'll get yourself in a lot of sticky situations, when you're fighting multiple enemies at once you're gonna find yourself struggling to dodge and parry every attack being thrown at you. With a couple of tweaks here and there I think that the new combat system has the potential to be really good. Other than the combat I think that the story is kinda weak compared to other AC games, I don't really want to spoil anything so the one thing that I'll say is that the list of targets that you have to assassinate in Origins is by far the weakest of any other AC game. I haven't encountered any game breaking glitches or bugs so far, or anything that would ruin the experience that this game creates for the players, however one other thing that you should know is that though Origins tries really hard to promote stealth it's near impossible to actually be stealthy, enemies can very easily spot you when you're hiding, even if you're behind a wall there's a high chance you'll still be spotted. Overall AC: Origins is deserving of an 8.75 in my opinion as it's a fairly decent comeback for the AC franchise.

This game is a terrible disappointment. Let me get the positives out of the way first, the environment in this game looks beautiful, the map is huge. But that's about the only positive that I can think of for this game. Let's start with the bad, the revamped battle system is complete sht. They tried to copy Witcher 3's battle system, which is arguably the worst part of Witcher 3. It's slow, unresponsive, and generally not very fun to get into fights. The biggest issue with the fighting system is this, the enemies can dash backwards, you can't dash forward. So that means you have to walk forward slowly to attack, while the enemies can hit you at that time. So that made most of the melee weapons useless (other than as a finisher when the enemies are stunned). Did they even test play this system? How the f did it even get past testing? So for most of the game I resort to using bow and arrow. They also nerfed the hidden blade, now it'll only do maybe 1/4 to 1/3 of the health of the mini bosses. In AC1 if you can time it perfectly you can one hit kill the final boss with a hidden blade counter! Now that's obviously too OP, but there's no reason to nerf the hidden blade this much. The leveling and experience gain also have issues. The exp you gain for kill enemies are very low, that's fine by itself. But they have made the game very level based, any enemies more than 3 levels higher you basically can't kill. So now I have to grind for exp. I'm sure this bs is put into the game to encourage people to buy their Time Savers Pack. I usually don't even mind grinding if the grinding feels natural, but this feels like they deliberately force you to grind (by nerfing the hidden blade) so you'll have to grind for levels. If you don't want to grind then you'll have to buy microtransactions. I think this is the last AC game for me. No more of this bs. I'll be waiting for the big gaming crash of these big publishers.

I think the character and story come close to rivalling AC 2 and Brotherhood. The open world is filled with content and looks stunning.

Yes, there are micro-transactions possible, if you want to finish the game quickly or want more outfits than the many that are already in the game. But nobody requires you to buy them. So I don't understand what people are **** about. The game-play is fluent and I have encountered only one bug since release. I don't think that one bug is an issue in a large open world game.

A lot of reviewers deemed the combat as a negative ,but it is actually better in every way than it was in the past 10 years. They managed to make it fun and challenging instead of making you a demi-god from it`s first few minutes. I love how they went back into ancient  times as it is here where the series truly shines with their weapons, scenery and allowing the developers to run wild with their imagination. The main character Bayek is the most realistic AC character in the series. Yeah he might not be the playboy bunny like Ecio ,but he is neither the dull justice addicted Konnor Hathaway. Bayek is just a caring husband with his few moments and that is honestly enough for him to drive the narrative. So is the game truly a 10/10? No. But many reviewers below me complete the game on platinum with +100 hours and still rate it a 2/10 which is ridiculous. Of course it has it`s problems like the side quests that are just mindless grind without any sense of importance ,but it gets an A for effort to put a fresh taste into a dying series.

My score is a red card. Please Ubi, I implore you to innovate. Stop making so dull games, AC games could be great, as they were at the beginning. But it needs to abandon the old formulas and templates of AC2. Make the world feel realistic and alive, make it systemic, with good AI, let us create informer networks, speak to npc's...

It seemed really good and it graphically, it looked really good. But just didn't meet my expectations. Ubisoft has gone downhill lately, like, a lot. They keep rushing games and they suck. I was very hesitant to buy Syndicate. I figured I'd be done with the franchise, but I watched the reviews closely and I caved. I bought it and I'm honestly satisfied. In some ways, they could've done a lot better, but I've had so much fun with the game that it gives me hope.

Take my opinion with a grain of salt.  After trying really hard to find something about Assassin's Creed I love for years now I have finally realized that I'm not so much an Assassin's Creed fan as I am a Black Flag fan.  Ever since Black Flag I have been chasing that high that came from owning my own pirate ship and exploring the open seas of the Caribbeans.  And although I did not hate Unity as much as most die hard Assassin's fans, it was not good enough to keep me playing.  I am afraid Syndicate is much the same.  Don't get me wrong, it is in my opinion a step forward from Unity, it is still the same old terrible climbing mechanics mixed with lookout posts, and following mini maps.  I did however like the fact that you can choose at any time to play as either Jacob or Evie Fry.  The chemistry between the brother and sister is extremely refreshing after years of being a lonely assassin.  Jacob is your stereotypical shoot first ask questions later hero, and Evie fits the original stealthy assassin that is used in the other Creed games.  The setting is Victorian London during the industrial revolution where gangs, corrupt officials, sweat shop employers and of coarse Templars roam.  Our two heroes are tasked with taking back london from the templars and give it back to the people.  As much as syndicate is a step in the right direction from Unity it still suffers the same setbacks as the rest, (Long time AC fans know what I mean).  All in all if you played any of the first 3 or 4 AC games, honestly you could probably say you played syndicate as well.  I dont know how they do it.  By that I mean release the same game over and over again in different settings and get thousands of other gamers and I to buy it every year.

I have little interest in the series unless the setting excites me, and as with the \"pirate\" theme of AC IV, I was eager to explore the streets of Victorian London. The story is as banal as it has ever been in an AC game, but at least the characters were a little bit more diverse. Had they not included the option to play through the game as Evie I don't believe I would have been able to finish this installment, as Jacob is as boring and cliche as they come. Where this game saves some face is in the presentation of the setting. The visuals are stunning, and the locations spectacular. The World War 1 side mission was enjoyable for as long as it lasted, and was certainly the highlight of this game. However, my main gripe with this game is in the mechanics. New mechanics introduced to the game all worked as expected, but the core mechanic, the parkour the series is marketed on, seems to be devolving rather than evolving from game to game. Animations are buggy and interaction with the environment is terribly mapped. The movement which should feel fluid and fast instead feels awkward and unnatural. Ultimately the grandeur of the game's setting, and avoiding a repeat of the disaster that was unity saved this game from a dismal score. With Black Flag I was eager to play the game every chance I got, and once I completed it I longed for more. With Syndicate my only motivation to complete the game was for the relatively easy Plat trophy. Once that goal was met, I was happy to put the game away and never play it again."], ["Marshb63", "User", "9", "I'm enjoying this game immensely.

I attempted to play the original game and then another one on the Sony PSP but this was the first start to finish one I have played.  To summarize the overall experience \"Pretty ****ing Awesome\".  This game had a lot of positives I enjoyed running through the streets and assassinating all the blighters and police officers I saw in the street.  I appreciated the open world Arkham Knight type world.  The collectable items were not forced on you like the Riddler trophies in Arkham Knight.  The individual memories / quests from notable historical figures was a great addition.  Helping out Winston Churchill in WWI, Protecting Karl Marx during a protest, and helping Darwin go ghost hunting was all a lot of fun.  The one downfall to the games story telling is the Main Story / Sequences.  This is probably where I lack since I never played the other games in the series.  So it was hard for me to understand what was going on.  They also never really truly explained what was going on in present time vs the memory sequences.  You get a quick brief interaction in the present in the beginning of the game.  Then in the middle you get another cut scene.  Then finally at the end of the game after the final battle you get another glimpse at what's going on in present time.  But this never gets fully explained.  So if you're new to the series like I am you are sort of at a loss of what is going on.  This is where the game fell short for me.  I was just never captivated by the main story since I had no connection nor did I have any idea what I was looking for in the main story.  Still even with lack of story telling for a new comer to the series the game was a blast.  The one draw back that most of these open games seem to struggle with and Batman Arkham Knight did too is the repetitive nature of the side missions.  Conquering territories was a very mundane but fun tasks.  Most missions have you either saving children from labor,  kidnapping some one, and or killing a bunch of blighters.  There is a big lack of variety in this mission ops.  The good thing is if you play the game like I do you can mix in conquering neighborhoods with finding all the games collectibles.  What did cause met a little bit a grief is I was really looking to get the coveted PS4 Platinum trophy in this game and did a pretty good job of getting close until I realized the only 2 trophies left were the Platinum and destroying 5000 objects while driving a carriage.  Now if this was on the Xbox One it would not have been a big issue for me since they feature achievement tracking and you can see how much you have left.  Most of the games trophies aren't bad at all but this one is truly a punch in the you know what.  Though a tracking system would really be helpful.  Now I understand that this is more of a PS4 issue than a Syndicate issue but nothing stops UBISoft from releasing an patch that will have a stat tracker similar to the Uncharted and MGS:TPP where you can see how close or far you are.  So while the game has its flaws a lot of the major issues I had were more user / OCD related.

However I do have to say that Unity is a huge let down for me and that really hurts being that I love this franchise too much. Even though I think you feel more like an assassin than in previous titles being that they added sneaking/crouching and taking on two or more enemies at once is a handful. There is also immense customization options for Arno's outfit and gear which I like. Free running feels like jogging it's slow and sometimes feels unresponsive, it's just not fluid as it has been in the previous titles. Also I may add that t co-op is terrible, I don't think any assassin's creed titles need multiplayer. In my opinion although they added neat little features like the sneaking ability and customization that should have been incorporated in previous titles, I have to say Ubisoft took a major step backwards with this iteration and the franchise which will ultimately affect my decision about buying another AC title in the future. If you were expecting something different out Unity compared to past titles, don't. Ultimately it feels more like a copy and paste trying to compete with CoD in a pissing match and CoD's bad luck is starting to rub off onto a once great franchise. The only thing different in Unity is the character you play as (Arno) and the setting (Paris 1789 French Revolution) the player is put in.  In conclusion, I am beginning to think the franchise has lost its 'mojo'. Ubisoft needs to take a break from the franchise or step up their game in the next iteration (no pun intended).

Is it a lie or you just kidding us?\" Well, I got this game in early 2015 and it downloaded about 6GB of patches. If that game really was unplayable, now it is not. The most fresh and impessive thing you can see there is co-op mode. No, not like it was in Black flag, stuff like \"Find that guard on small map and kill him screaming DIE YOU MISERABLE GUARD\". Real, real co-op. With real missions like you play in single player. Incredible feelings.  Also in this game you will find more customization options,there a way more weapons and clothings and now they have own stats, and really matter. You came with bad equipment to wrong district, start fighting with guards and boom, you are dead. No more terminator-stuff with hidden blade. Really good point. So, if you are AC fun and still thinking about buy or not this game, you are missing decent game, where low-fps ( rarely to be honest) and so called EVIL BUGS( which are mostly removed, I believe)  really will not spoil your good impressions.

They already took action and are working hard on solving the problems. Does that make everything good? No. But they are giving their best at least to solve it.

To put it short AC unity is lackluster. Now lets start at the beginning, First the story. In the story of ACU we are introduced to Arno, a common a kid who orphaned after his dad died of a murder. He now lives with a family in the upper class. The daughter of the family he lives with is an obvious love interest. The story is not all that interesting, there is no cool plat twist. No character stands out, the only thing it does right is add to the lore of the AC universe. Arno is a pretty flat character. He is charismatic in all the wrong ways. So overall the story is not why you should buy this game. Now the game play, the game-play is greatly refined with a new parkour mechanic allowing to ascend and descend. However I think the descend mechanic needs some work. The parkour is also pretty glitch. While running on rooftops Arno will get stuck jump super far randomly and is generally pretty choppy.The new fighting mechanic is pretty good. It is now more challenging.... However they still throw enemy after enemy after you like in the old games. This is so annoying since combat is harder we cant fight 20 guys at once, however the game doesn't seem to care. Next the AI is pretty, who am I kidding its god awful. In combat the walk around and when they deiced to attack you they do a extremely dumb animation. Its like they growl at you before swinging. And the most annoying thing of all is the guns. The enemies will often just spam using their guns forcing you to get them first, however the controls to doge the gun fire is broken. To dodge a gun shot you have to push the X button however, if you are not near an enemy you cant doge it unless you run behind something. The gun system is horrible they need to redo it. Next lets talk stealth. To put it simply its crap. Mainly due to the enemy placement.The enemies are placed in a way that it is almost impossible to take out anyone without being detected. Unless you use the \"phantom blade\" which is basically a silenced gun. However you only get like 5 at a time and it costs so much to refill them all. The stealth seems like it was made for a splinter cell game. I say this because without a gun you are screwed. Now lets end this up with the multiplayer. It is odd. It is definitely enjoyable if you get your friends, but without people you now it is not all that fun. The stealth is a lot more enjoyable when you work together but not by much."], ["Hynch", "User", "5", "Missions are boring. It's nearly impossible to play the game stealth. Framerate is terrible.

In the Atelier series they always trying to add something new, so in this game they made a new Alchemy system. This new Alchemy system is interesting because now Sophie can learn new recipes through various activities and when she performs alchemy, the player needs to solve the easy puzzle to receives a bonus. This function reminds me of the Alchemy system in Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis where the player must choose a certain color on the roulette to get a bonus, while in Atelier Sophie the player needs to solve the puzzle. Also in Atelier Sophie they have made a new battle system. This new battle system looks just like a traditional Turn-based battle system with some new functions. My favorite battle system in the Atelier series is the one in the Mana Khemia series. The battle system in the Mana Khemia series was the best improvement of the traditional Turn-based battle system.

If you didn't like them, you still will like this game. I hate LoL and DOTA 2 because they are too complicated and too much is going on on screen. Awesomenauts simplifies things by 3 v 3 gameplay and instead of one giant item pool being available for any character to select from, the characters have their own specific items available for purchase. I'm not saying this game is simple, because there is definitely strategy and teamwork involved (HUGE emphasis on teamwork), it's just that these simplifications compared to other MOBAs are what makes this game so approachable but at the same time full of opportunity and character mastery. Engaging in matches where everyone is a noob is just fun and crazy. Playing matches where everyone is playing like a god makes for a super fun and intense match that feels so great to win at or leaves you feeling honorable and deserving of respect even if defeated. There are countless builds each character can create with the set of items specific to them, but you still know what to expect from each enemy you encounter if you know their moves and items at their disposal, which helps you develop good strategies for taking them out. Combining this logic with teams who are great with the characters they play as and all have good strategies against the other players they are facing makes for battles that need an audience. This game is constantly being updated making it bigger and better than before and I would highly suggest buying it for its very reasonable price.

Music is a boring and repetitive mix between chiptune, ambient, and weird middle eastern \"allu akbar\" type vocals, thankfully I have Spotify. Theres a lot of weapons, however none of them are chargeable and most are useless. The tool upgrades are pretty bad too (no double jump but instead an awkward short teleport thing keyed to the control stick, no space jump even though theres a \"space jump\" upgrade that increases height by 1 pixel.) The boss battles are very boring and can either be hamrushed or cheap shotted very quickly, and the later battles can be skipped altogether, being rewarded for laziness with secret trophies. The plot is terrible and is told mainly through hidden notes (most of which need to be translated). The glitches are pretty bad even after several patches, and Ive also had issues getting certain trophies to pop.

You have number of methods to dispatch your enemy and all of the mechanics are cool. The setting is very immersive and possibly my favorite one in the series.

My score is a red card. Please Ubi, I implore you to innovate. Stop making so dull games, AC games could be great, as they were at the beginning. But it needs to abandon the old formulas and templates of AC2. Make the world feel realistic and alive, make it systemic, with good AI, let us create informer networks, speak to npc's...

The characters Evie and Jacob are a great combination for a linear storyline. Both of them great, interesting, and fun to play with and in addition you can switch between them and play every time you wish in the free roam. The things that AC syndicate fails its with the modern day story. It follows the same old steps as Unity, no gameplay just cut scenes. It feels like Ubisoft don't wish to continue the modern day story, they neglected this element completely and its a shame because the modern day story brought the series to its glory with ACII and ACB, but unfortunately the modern day story is weird and confusing, adds little information and masses up things even more. Another thing that is bad in the game its the combat system. The combat feels clunky and weird, although it looks brutal but very easy to attack enemies, no stealth approach at all , no matter how you'll try to be stealthy there will be a point that you will be exposed and you'll have to fight and this is frustrating and not really enjoyable.

Ever since Black Flag I have been chasing that high that came from owning my own pirate ship and exploring the open seas of the Caribbeans.  And although I did not hate Unity as much as most die hard Assassin's fans, it was not good enough to keep me playing.  I am afraid Syndicate is much the same.  Don't get me wrong, it is in my opinion a step forward from Unity, it is still the same old terrible climbing mechanics mixed with lookout posts, and following mini maps.  I did however like the fact that you can choose at any time to play as either Jacob or Evie Fry.  The chemistry between the brother and sister is extremely refreshing after years of being a lonely assassin.  Jacob is your stereotypical shoot first ask questions later hero, and Evie fits the original stealthy assassin that is used in the other Creed games.  The setting is Victorian London during the industrial revolution where gangs, corrupt officials, sweat shop employers and of coarse Templars roam.  Our two heroes are tasked with taking back london from the templars and give it back to the people.  As much as syndicate is a step in the right direction from Unity it still suffers the same setbacks as the rest, (Long time AC fans know what I mean).  All in all if you played any of the first 3 or 4 AC games, honestly you could probably say you played syndicate as well.  I dont know how they do it.  By that I mean release the same game over and over again in different settings and get thousands of other gamers and I to buy it every year.

I have little interest in the series unless the setting excites me, and as with the \"pirate\" theme of AC IV, I was eager to explore the streets of Victorian London. The story is as banal as it has ever been in an AC game, but at least the characters were a little bit more diverse. Had they not included the option to play through the game as Evie I don't believe I would have been able to finish this installment, as Jacob is as boring and cliche as they come. Where this game saves some face is in the presentation of the setting. The visuals are stunning, and the locations spectacular. The World War 1 side mission was enjoyable for as long as it lasted, and was certainly the highlight of this game. However, my main gripe with this game is in the mechanics. New mechanics introduced to the game all worked as expected, but the core mechanic, the parkour the series is marketed on, seems to be devolving rather than evolving from game to game. Animations are buggy and interaction with the environment is terribly mapped. The movement which should feel fluid and fast instead feels awkward and unnatural. Ultimately the grandeur of the game's setting, and avoiding a repeat of the disaster that was unity saved this game from a dismal score.

I attempted to play the original game and then another one on the Sony PSP but this was the first start to finish one I have played.  To summarize the overall experience \"Pretty ****ing Awesome\".  This game had a lot of positives I enjoyed running through the streets and assassinating all the blighters and police officers I saw in the street.  I appreciated the open world Arkham Knight type world.  The collectable items were not forced on you like the Riddler trophies in Arkham Knight.  The individual memories / quests from notable historical figures was a great addition.  Helping out Winston Churchill in WWI, Protecting Karl Marx during a protest, and helping Darwin go ghost hunting was all a lot of fun.  The one downfall to the games story telling is the Main Story / Sequences.  This is probably where I lack since I never played the other games in the series.  So it was hard for me to understand what was going on.  They also never really truly explained what was going on in present time vs the memory sequences.  You get a quick brief interaction in the present in the beginning of the game.  Then in the middle you get another cut scene.  Then finally at the end of the game after the final battle you get another glimpse at what's going on in present time.  But this never gets fully explained.  So if you're new to the series like I am you are sort of at a loss of what is going on.  This is where the game fell short for me.  I was just never captivated by the main story since I had no connection nor did I have any idea what I was looking for in the main story.

The one draw back that most of these open games seem to struggle with and Batman Arkham Knight did too is the repetitive nature of the side missions.  Conquering territories was a very mundane but fun tasks.  Most missions have you either saving children from labor,  kidnapping some one, and or killing a bunch of blighters.  There is a big lack of variety in this mission ops.  The good thing is if you play the game like I do you can mix in conquering neighborhoods with finding all the games collectibles.  What did cause met a little bit a grief is I was really looking to get the coveted PS4 Platinum trophy in this game and did a pretty good job of getting close until I realized the only 2 trophies left were the Platinum and destroying 5000 objects while driving a carriage.  Now if this was on the Xbox One it would not have been a big issue for me since they feature achievement tracking and you can see how much you have left.  Most of the games trophies aren't bad at all but this one is truly a punch in the you know what.  Though a tracking system would really be helpful.  Now I understand that this is more of a PS4 issue than a Syndicate issue but nothing stops UBISoft from releasing an patch that will have a stat tracker similar to the Uncharted and MGS:TPP where you can see how close or far you are.  So while the game has its flaws a lot of the major issues I had were more user / OCD related.  This is a great game to pick up whether your a fan of the series or not and just run around and have fun."], ["kewldawg6969", "User", "9", "I think that this is a great game and the best AC yet"], ["bigdeadanimals", "User", "7", "Quite a good game, but there some thing that make me dissapointed"], ["legendmax", "User", "8", "Assassins creed syndicate is a great game and it actually makes from the big disappointment that is assassins creed unity.

I skipped Unity because of the terrible reviews, so I wasn't sure what to expect with Syndicate.  If you liked Black Flag, you will like Syndicate.  Now that I think of it, this game is very similar to Batman Arkham series which might be why I like it so much.  HUGE open world map.  Lots to do and explore.  Tons of collectibles.  The graphics are spectacular.  The gameplay is typical AC - sometimes your character doesn't go exactly where you want, but it's not too bad.

If it had more fluid combat system, (batman, maybe), with an interesting story, this would be outstanding, sadly these features are not here.

There is also immense customization options for Arno's outfit and gear which I like. Free running feels like jogging it's slow and sometimes feels unresponsive, it's just not fluid as it has been in the previous titles. Also I may add that t co-op is terrible, I don't think any assassin's creed titles need multiplayer. In my opinion although they added neat little features like the sneaking ability and customization that should have been incorporated in previous titles, I have to say Ubisoft took a major step backwards with this iteration and the franchise which will ultimately affect my decision about buying another AC title in the future. If you were expecting something different out Unity compared to past titles, don't. Ultimately it feels more like a copy and paste trying to compete with CoD in a pissing match and CoD's bad luck is starting to rub off onto a once great franchise. The only thing different in Unity is the character you play as (Arno) and the setting (Paris 1789 French Revolution) the player is put in.

They already took action and are working hard on solving the problems. Does that make everything good? No. But they are giving their best at least to solve it.

Nearly every bad review is only showing how bad the frame rate is and the many bugs etc. It is a problem that will be solved and was solved many times in different games.

To put it short AC unity is lackluster. Now lets start at the beginning, First the story. In the story of ACU we are introduced to Arno, a common a kid who orphaned after his dad died of a murder. He now lives with a family in the upper class. The daughter of the family he lives with is an obvious love interest. The story is not all that interesting, there is no cool plat twist. No character stands out, the only thing it does right is add to the lore of the AC universe. Arno is a pretty flat character. He is charismatic in all the wrong ways. So overall the story is not why you should buy this game. Now the game play, the game-play is greatly refined with a new parkour mechanic allowing to ascend and descend. However I think the descend mechanic needs some work. The parkour is also pretty glitch. While running on rooftops Arno will get stuck jump super far randomly and is generally pretty choppy.The new fighting mechanic is pretty good. It is now more challenging.... However they still throw enemy after enemy after you like in the old games. This is so annoying since combat is harder we cant fight 20 guys at once, however the game doesn't seem to care. Next the AI is pretty, who am I kidding its god awful. In combat the walk around and when they deiced to attack you they do a extremely dumb animation. Its like they growl at you before swinging. And the most annoying thing of all is the guns. The enemies will often just spam using their guns forcing you to get them first, however the controls to doge the gun fire is broken. To dodge a gun shot you have to push the X button however, if you are not near an enemy you cant doge it unless you run behind something. The gun system is horrible they need to redo it. Next lets talk stealth. To put it simply its crap. Mainly due to the enemy placement.The enemies are placed in a way that it is almost impossible to take out anyone without being detected. Unless you use the \"phantom blade\" which is basically a silenced gun. However you only get like 5 at a time and it costs so much to refill them all. The stealth seems like it was made for a splinter cell game. I say this because without a gun you are screwed. Now lets end this up with the multiplayer. It is odd. It is definitely enjoyable if you get your friends, but without people you now it is not all that fun. The stealth is a lot more enjoyable when you work together but not by much."], ["Hynch", "User", "5", "Missions are boring. It's nearly impossible to play the game stealth. Framerate is terrible.

Coming in a year and a half later, I feel safe in ignoring all of these. I am not going to \"platinum\" this game, so the collectibles don't matter.

It's main problems is there's no way to get past the enemies' defenses. You mostly have to wait and parry endlessly until Arno ACTUALLY hit them after blocking so you can get a hit, which depending on your enemy's attack, might not happen much.

This new Alchemy system is interesting because now Sophie can learn new recipes through various activities and when she performs alchemy, the player needs to solve the easy puzzle to receives a bonus.

They used that battle system again in Atelier Escha & Logy and Atelier Shallie but unfortunately they did not put this battle system in Atelier Sophie."]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "PlayStation Vita"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/009abe6e45357af304a2791125876d9b.jpg"}

It's so addictive and fun and each character is just so unique its crazy. If you ever played League of Legends or Dota and enjoy MOBAs then you should like this one too. If you didn't like them, you still will like this game. I hate LoL and DOTA 2 because they are too complicated and too much is going on on screen. Awesomenauts simplifies things by 3 v 3 gameplay and instead of one giant item pool being available for any character to select from, the characters have their own specific items available for purchase. I'm not saying this game is simple, because there is definitely strategy and teamwork involved (HUGE emphasis on teamwork), it's just that these simplifications compared to other MOBAs are what makes this game so approachable but at the same time full of opportunity and character mastery. Engaging in matches where everyone is a noob is just fun and crazy. Playing matches where everyone is playing like a god makes for a super fun and intense match that feels so great to win at or leaves you feeling honorable and deserving of respect even if defeated. There are countless builds each character can create with the set of items specific to them, but you still know what to expect from each enemy you encounter if you know their moves and items at their disposal, which helps you develop good strategies for taking them out. Combining this logic with teams who are great with the characters they play as and all have good strategies against the other players they are facing makes for battles that need an audience. This game is constantly being updated making it bigger and better than before and I would highly suggest buying it for its very reasonable price.

When your review is nothing but an essay about how the game isn't your style, you come off like a jackass."], ["Kingmalekith", "User", "1", "Play a real Metroid game, not a blatant ripoff with hipster overtones."], ["archonreptoid", "User", "9", "I started the game with some reservation This because a lot of retro metroidvania games i,ve played over the years didn't quite live up to the original masterpieces like maze of galious and usas. At the moment im about 4 hours into the game, and must say that i think it is really great. From the complex layout of it's maze, to the joy of discovering new weapons, health packs, hidden rooms, ways to reach that one place you coudn't just before."], ["True_Reclaimer", "User", "0", "-0 to balance all the 10s- Has the worst parts of the original NES Metroid, none of the modern advancements of Super Metroid, Fusion, or Zero Mission. Controls are clunky (shouldve been twin stick shooting option), map is horrible (no zoom, no waypoints, no treasure indicator), no dashing/running and no warp rooms makes travel incredibly painful and slow. Music is a boring and repetitive mix between chiptune, ambient, and weird middle eastern \"allu akbar\" type vocals, thankfully I have Spotify. Theres a lot of weapons, however none of them are chargeable and most are useless. The tool upgrades are pretty bad too (no double jump but instead an awkward short teleport thing keyed to the control stick, no space jump even though theres a \"space jump\" upgrade that increases height by 1 pixel.) The boss battles are very boring and can either be hamrushed or cheap shotted very quickly, and the later battles can be skipped altogether, being rewarded for laziness with secret trophies. The plot is terrible and is told mainly through hidden notes (most of which need to be translated). The glitches are pretty bad even after several patches, and Ive also had issues getting certain trophies to pop. Overall one of the most overrated metroid-esque sidescrollers, and unless you were a huge mega fanboy of NES but hated Super Nintendo and everything after, I highly recommend passing on this or at least wait till it's PS+ Free. Final Review - 4/10"], ["Geekman", "User", "10", "It's a great game that fills the 5 year gap since the last Metroid released. It's to Metroid what Shovel Knight was to Megaman, meaning there are lots of similarities, but it still feels like its own thing. The world of Axiom Verge, in my opinion is a lot more interesting than that of the original Metroid, and I feel the game in general is far superior to it;s NES inspiration. You'll get lost a lot, but that's kind of the charm to Metroid games. Finding out what you need to do and what you need to have to do it. It's very satisfying. The protagonist isn't the most interesting, but frankly, it doesn't matter too much in a game like this."], ["captainkane", "User", "6", "Axiom Verge is a mediocre platformer with an identity crisis. AV is labeled a metroidvania game, but it's an homage to NES platformers. Super Metroid is a near perfect masterpiece that still sets the gold standard for 2D platformers. The music, level design, and visuals were crafted with superb attention to detail. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night took SM\u2019s formula and pumped it full of steroids. The result is another legendary platformer. Both games aged incredibly well. When developers mimic them, they inadvertently highlight why those 2 games are still widely considered the best platformers ever."], ["Celtro", "User", "7", "An adequate super metroid clone; more of a copy than an homage. Once I'd completed my first play-through, I can't honestly say I wanted to jump back in and discover all its secrets. I get that it was all produced by one guy, but seeing as thye want fifteen quid for it, i think its fair game. One or two really poor boss battles didn't help either. Worth a look but don't hold your breath."], ["Zimbardo", "User", "4", "A decent Metroid clone but GOD DAMN there's so much running back and forth every-time you get a new item. This is a cheap way to extend game-play and it's a complete failure to include map markers when you're playing as a space gofer. The first 1/2 of the game was enjoyable but it got old fast."], ["Dorana", "User", "9", "This game really captures the original Metroid feeling."], ["drnasty", "User", "8", "Axiom Verge takes me back to a time when I really loved the Nintendo games and consoles. It is classic in its controls, gameplay, level design and the music is great. It is nostalgic like the original Metroid and Super Metroid - my favourites of the series."], ["rosnk30", "User", "7", "A great nostalgic game from nines (style). Axiom Verge's a 'metroidvania' style with a lot of challenge. One of them is a big exploration that game offers turning the experience bigger and better. The storyline in my opinion is great not more like was this kind of games from the past."], ["DrakeGarrison", "User", "8", "A failed scientist dies in an accident, only to awaken in a mysterious, alien world. Where is he? How did he get here? And why do the fundamental laws of reality appear broken? Life. Afterlife. Real. Virtual. Dream. Nightmare. It's a thin line. It's Axiom Verge. [Thomas Happ]"], ["GreenMachineG", "User", "8", "Axiom Verge teleports you back to the prime of Metroid-Vania platforming. If you loved Metroid or Castlevania as a kid then you MUST play this game. The retro aesthetic and gameplay feel exactly like a game in those veins. I give a salute to the creator for matching up with how the old games felt and played, and the additions made in this game are tons of fun! Definitely a game worth giving a shot! I will however say that in the modern age of gaming that games such as these are easily overtaken by bigger games, and if you are a modern gamer exclusively who only plays big name titles, then I would skip this as the old school gameplay will probably bore you, which is a shame."], ["Bumblebugbee", "User", "8", "They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; that is clearly the case with this wonderful game.  Axiom Verge not only pays homage to Metroid but adds a lot of personality and clever design to the mix.  This game is starts off with a clear theme and continually expands on it in surprising ways.  Its obvious that this game was developed by an individual, one with a bold vision of taking a classic genre and twisting it to the limits of his imagination.  Those who grew up playing Metroidvania style games or those who are just fans of side-scrollers are going to find a lot to love with this game."], ["Winko", "User", "7", "Good:"], ["MudMonger", "User", "10", "Quite possibly my favorite game in the last year. Played front to back and barely put it down. Could not wait to get off work to play this again. well done."], ["raccoondaddy", "User", "8", "Axiom Verge borrows a lot from Metroid 1 and Super Metroid and more or less is a love letter to the two.  Carrying it's own intriguing, yet simplistic plot that is coupled with that great old-school action we got from its inspirations.  Gadgets are fun to use and boss fights are tense and challenging, but not unbeatable.  My only problem is, that the music does get a little annoying during prolonged sittings.  Turning it down a couple notches does help."]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "PlayStation Vita", "Switch", "Wii U", "Xbox One"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/fac71fc172a5990f76e79701238971a7.jpg"}
