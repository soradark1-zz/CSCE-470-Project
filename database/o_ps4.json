Even if  you haven't played any of the past titles, you can jump straight into this next generation title and feel right at the moment. The game plays a similar feel of the past titles as it retells the epic story of the straw hat crew, from the beginning of building the crew and meeting unforgettable characters, to up until the newest anime episode in Japan! If you have heard of the One Piece craze that has swept the world and don't have time to watch all 600+ episodes, give Pirate Warriors 3 a go. The story touches on the most important events within the show and cuts out all of the fat of the not so relevant adventure moments. With the next gen technology, the game allows a ton more soldiers on the field to take on and rendered very smoothly from the past titles. A great addition to any fan of Dynasty Warriors or of course....ONE PIECE!"], ["Tano77", "User", "9", "So, like many other who have bought this game, I was sceptical and thought it would be a cliche game with a horrible storytelling and minimum amusement."], ["Juantatz", "User", "10", "If you like one piece, this is your game, so many things to do, good history everything you have ever wanted.

If you know what you're getting into and it matches with your personal tastes, you'll find a lot to love in Onechanbara Z2 Chaos. Its plot, characters, and script are what you'd get from Japanese grindhouse / shock horror like The Machine Girl, complete with all the gore, sexuality, and campiness that entails. The biggest real complaint is that environments are a bit bland, but at least the levels span the modern globe and allow you to play in whatever order you see fit. Rest assured that the game isn't alpha-quality clunkiness like its XBox360 predecessor (nobody played the Wii one anyway), and everything from character models to core gameplay mechanics have been drastically improved to make this the best Onechanbara game to date. Tamsoft and publishers D3 and XSEED seem well aware of this, as the game comes with both in-game and physical extras that get you caught up on the story of earlier bad releases. New retail copies pack in an art book / field guide and the OST, along with some fittingly ridiculous costume DLC, and at $49.99, it's still somewhat bargain-priced for a new PS4 release. As for the game's content, you can expect an insane amount of visual customization for all four playable girls, allowing you to change everything from base outfits and hats to accessories you can reposition all over their bodies. Combat mechanics are where Onechanbara really shines and shows the most vital improvements, and even though it should feel repetitive, the variety of playable females, skill enhancements, unique weaponry, and genuinely fun beat-em-up stages give the whole package some staying power. I immediately recalled fond memories of older action favorites like Gungrave and Bujingai, so if you enjoyed either of those, you'll probably understand the flavor I'm trying to describe here. Combat includes some interesting mechanics like weapon refresh that slings the blood off of your worn-down blades, berserk modes and transformations, team cross-attacks, enemy dismemberment, timing-based combo boosts, switchable secondary weapons, sub-weapons, chase/follow dashes, and on-screen quick time prompts that utilize the DS4's touch pad (or Vita's touchscreen if using Remote Play). That's right, if you're a Vita player, you'll already know that most triple-A titles neglect Remote Play, but Onechanbara works like a dang dream. It's easily the most fine-tuned Remote Play experience outside of Tomb Raider, and it elevates the game further for anyone needing to use that feature. While the control scheme isn't drastically altered for Remote Play, even the controls that seem like they'd be awkward on paper make sense once you've got the DS4/Vita in your hands, and I was shocked the first time a quick time command worked flawlessly on my Vita's touchscreen. I didn't expect it because the game is so good via Remote Play that I'd forgotten I wasn't playing an actual Vita title. The moment I entered the touch command, I thought to myself \"oh, that's not going to work on... holy crap, it worked!\" All these little things you don't expect from a B-tier game add up to make it worth more than the sum of its parts, so if it sounds like Onechanbara fits your personal tastes, you should definitely give it a chance.

In the remote mountains of Colorado, horrors await inside Mount Massive Asylum. A long-abandoned home for the mentally ill, it has been recently re-opened by the research and charity branch of the transnational Murkoff Corporation and operates in strict secrecy... until now. Acting on a tip from an anonymous source, independent journalist Miles Upshur breaks into the facility and what he discovers treads a terrifying line between science, religion, nature and something else entirely. Once inside, his only hope of escape lies with the terrible truth at the heart of Mount Massive.

The level design, though, is well done and the asylum itself is eery, sickening, and disturbing all at the same time.  The story itself is very slow building, but once the final section begins the various notes, documents, and banter from asylum prisoners makes perfect sense.  The ending twist is awesome.

In Outlast your heart rate is constantly up as you creep through the dark corridors in Mount Massive Asylum using your video camera to record and document events or using the night vision when there is no other light source.

It's not that the game is hard, it's an artificial difficulty to extend the playtime. After seeing the same animations 5 times it is no longer shocking or scary.

First off, the guy you play never seems to really be scared.  In fact, the pedal is put to the metal with his cheesy douche talk.  You see, as he progresses he writes stuff in his journal (he's doing some investigative reporting) detailing the things he's come across, most of which would scared the f*cking Bejesus out of just about any living human being on the planet not in some kind of vegetative state or perhaps blind, deaf and hard of smell.  He's chased by large, beastly dudes, buff naked twins, a torture doctor taken straight out of a Rob Zombie film and even some supernatural ****  That doctor dude even cuts a few of his fingers off.  All pretty good stuff game-wise.  However, this cat just trudges through it all like it's not too big a deal, writing smart-ass remarks in his notebook.  He may as well be writing about a NFL playoff game or the morning traffic, because you wouldn't know by the tone of it. It really took me out of the moment every single time I read an entry.  The documents you find thankfully aren't bad and give you clues to the story.  Other than that, the only real gripes I have are that after you figure out the flow of the game you can just kinda trial and error your way through just running and not hiding as all the scenarios are almost exactly the same set-up.  Get to an area, sneak around to turn on valves and escape to the next section with someone chasing you.  The game length is fairly short, which is good, because that nagging repetition starts creeping in as you progress.  Overall, I was legitimately creeped out many times and felt a high amount of tension throughout most of the game.

A guard would check the locker next to you instead of randomly (every time).  If you pick something up an enemy shows up (also every time).

Unfortuently this really made the game frustrating when you get to the middle section of the game which takes place in the forest and there is little to no clear direction a lot of the time with an enemy that can attack you from a ranged distance. there were parts in this section of the game that were so frustrating that I wanted to quit the game entirely and the worst part was that this section of the game I didn't find scary at all and it took me about 2 hours or so until this part was over with. on a positive note, I loved how the game implemented some psychological horror into the game, and created some of the games best moments. when the game was scary, it was really scary. I didn't find the characters as memorable as the first game unfortuently and that was kind of a bummer but I still felt atleast two of the main bad guys for lack of a better term were pretty intimidating, with one of them being very forgettable to me, but I appreciate that they tried something different with this character. the story was kindof a mess, because unless your reading the files and notes you pick up, your gonna be left very confused by the end, and even if you do understand whats going on, I felt that the story was underwhelming in the same way a story about how in the end it was all just a dream is underwhelming, it has a similar thing going on. over all I was kind of disspaointed in the game as a whole, but the game was really scary most of the time and I really appreciate the developers for taking risks even though they didn't all pay off, and I think it is a game worth playing if you were a fan of the first game, but maybe wait for a discounted price."], ["TheCatalyst", "User", "4", "Disappointed.

The backstory is interesting, the cast is an unparalleled multi-cultural mix of instantly lovable personalities, the visual design is sublime, and the online functionality is flawlessly fluid. I love the concept of leveling for cosmetic loot, incentives for backfilling quick matches is genius in that it keeps you engaged and progressing regardless of your team's skill or success, and the contextual awareness between the characters you control means you don't even have to talk with strangers if you'd prefer to keep the mic off.

All game-modes are objective-based, meaning that you must work as a team to defeat your opposition. Granted there is no campaign, but in a game like this it is not necessary whatsoever, there are animated shorts found online that give various characters there own backstory which add a nice touch to this sort of game. The gameplay is nice and smooth, with a stable frame-rate and feels extremely satisfying, Right now the summary of the game is out the way, I would like to turn to those who complain about this game and find loopholes in their complaints. First of all, yes it's online only, but this type of gameplay has already provided me and my friends with hundreds of hours of entertainment, not every game needs a campaign. Secondly, to the people who say this game should be free, future content for this game is free, granted not loot boxes as they're merely cosmetic choices, but anything to enhance gameplay is completely free of charge, Blizzard have stated this themselves, you're basically paying for all this dlc ahead of time, all of these purchases have been funded towards the future content, and so far, from Ana and Eichenwalde, they have delivered, with plenty more to come. Thirdly, to the people saying this game has only gained popularity through Blizzard's prestige is just straight hating the company and game imo. Honestly? I only played one Blizzard game before Overwatch, and that was World of Warcraft, and I didn't even like that game, hell, when I first heard of Overwatch I honestly brushed it aside and was more interested in Battleborn, oh how the tides have turned, and I can vouch there are more people like me who came along with next to information and have enjoyed this game, especially my friends.

Firstly, without that, the game does not particularly justify either it's cost or the COD style microtransactions, which should NOT be in here (damn you Activision). The story/opening cutscene bit hints at interesting lore and PvE which is totally absent, and is therefore totally confusing; had this game had some sort of PvE it could have been pushing towards 9/10. Other games get **** for not having coherent SP campaigns of this sort, but the Overwatch marketing machine seems to have given it a pass. No doubt I'll still be playing this for as long as my friends are, but personally I have found very few characters gratifying to play as, mostly due to the lack of sprint, making play slow and irritating if you die a couple of times in succession (hence I mostly use Tracer). No doubt this is a good game, if somewhat lacking in content, but as usual has been hyped up to such proportions that all the mainline reviewers were only ever going to give it 8/9/10 etc. Why these people get caught up in the hype even more than most of the player base I have no idea, but maybe the user scores can be a little more representative.

Most of the stuff contained in loot crates are garbage aside from the skins.  It's obvious that they were just trying to find random things to fill in the crates and keep you on the hamster wheel.  The better alternative would have been to have individual armor / skin pieces and allow you to mix and match parts so that you can really get creative and custom.  It's an area where I think MOBA's and Hero shooters lack.  Skins are nice but it's more fun to allow inter-skin / armor mix and matching would go a long way and then you can introduce new character armor and the loot boxes now have more value instead of getting a dumb spray paint or heroic entrance and stuff like that.

Overwatch is a team based tactical first-person shooter which pits 6 V 6 players againgst each other in objective game modes, which consists of protecting/ take over a base and escorting a \"robot\" to its destination. What makes overwatch unique is that it consists of 21 unique characters who all have different weapons and special abilities. Overwatch basically takes every cool element in video games (teleportation, grappling hooks, wall running, etc) and puts them in a pot and shares them equally with every unique character; and characters are surprisingly very balanced, you'll wish they just had one different power so they'll be perfect. It's mostly a spamfest of special abilities, and I enjoy it.

Don't get me wrong, it's a great game. However, there are noticeable problems present, and I think a bunch of critics out there are failing to see them. Let's start off with the game's pricing. Overwatch is ridiculously overpriced, sitting at $60 for console users. What about PC, you may ask? $40. That's right, Blizzard is actually forcing console users to pay extra for the game. I know most of their games are PC exclusives, but this is extremely unfair. Even at $40 I would say it's overpriced, mainly due to a lack of content. I mentioned this as a complaint to one of my friends who is a huge fan of the game. He said the $60 pricing was fine because all of the content would be added in later updates. Well, why? That doesn't make any sense. Either delay the game so you can add the content upon release, or lower the price and make it DLC. I'd rather have the content be paid DLC than be forced to buy it when I'm probably not gonna have use for it any ways. As mentioned earlier, there is definitely a lack of content in the game, especially with a $60 price tag. Most noticeably is a story mode, which I actually hope will be added in a future update because I definitely think that could bring the score up for me. I guess it's because they want you to learn the story from watching the animations, but who's got time to do that? Plus, I wouldn't bother, they're not that interesting. There's also a pretty large lack of gamemodes, which is a big issue for a multiplayer only game. But I've been a little too hard on Overwatch, let's give it a little credit. One thing in this game that goes without flaw is the heroes. The main selling point of the game is it's 21 playable characters. This was clearly a design focus, because they knocked it out of the park. Each hero feels and plays to match they're class perfectly, and I'm always tempted to try different characters. Each of these heroes have their own weapons and abilities, adding a lot of variety to these characters. It's also worth noting that they all have their own personalities. Personally, this is something that loads of multiplayer games are lacking now a days. I'd much rather see a quirky, British teleporter as the mascot of the game than a stone-faced, one-sided cyborg soldier. This and a large amount of maps elevate this game to my score for it. In total, Overwatch is a great game set back by some issues with pricing and a lack of content. However, the focus on all of the heroes, each individual playstyle, and a variety of maps serve this game right. It doesn't in any way deserve all of the perfect scores from critics, but it's not bad. 7/10."], ["Searth", "User", "9", "Overwatch...

There are many characters to fit whichever playstyle suits you best. It's vibrant, with great maps and the online runs well. Most of the time it puts you into matches of equally skilled opponents, which is the other main point to nail in a competitive game. One thing to note is that having a few friends in a team based game like this to play with on the regular vastly influences how much fun you'll have with this title. The other thing worth mentioning is that although this game will keep you busy for dozens of hours I wouldn't say it quite has the variety from match to match to keep me hooked like some previous blizzard greats, such as diablo 2, warcraft 3 or starcraft 2. I think that it has something to do with a lack of real progression and the loot boxes are sort of \"Meh\".

For me there are a few points that make it lose some score in my opinion. In terms of gameplay, the game feels great, you have 20+ heroes, each one feels very different, they all have 3-5 different skills, there\u2019s a game style for everyone here. I also think they\u2019ve managed to balance the heroes quite well, that doesn\u2019t mean you can kill any hero with any hero; it means each hero is strong against some heroes and weak against some others, balance within a specific game is completely dependent on people making the right choice. As long as people think a bit when choosing, rather than going \u201cGenji is my main no matter what\u201d, it is easy to have a combination of heroes that is balanced, being \u201ccombination\u201d the key word here. Said that the gameplay wildly varies between heroes, you have very fast pacing heroes that have to move a lot (e.g. Genji/Tracer), bulky slow kind of heroes (e.g Mei, Reindhardt), healers, etc. etc. Graphically speaking, the game is good, not awesome but I think it stands out by its art style rather that the raw quality of the graphics, music and sound are all right, nothing out of the ordinary but they work all right. Story wise, this being a multiplayer online game, you won\u2019t find a lot of story elements in the game itself, but Blizzard has made an awesome job at giving you context via comics and short movies that you can access online for free. That is quite cool, although I still miss a campaign mode, seeing the universe they\u2019ve created, the main story and the charisma of the characters I think it would be relatively easy to make an awesome campaign. Finally, for those trying to think about how playing this feels I think it\u2019s fair to say that this is a mixture between a multiplayer FPS and a MOBA (e.g. league of legends), so if you played some of those, just expect something that falls in the middle, at least it feels like this to me."], ["RodSal", "User", "7", "Game is fun and have really simple mechanics.

Considering my usual tastes in gaming I should dislike this game but with all of that said most of the elements really work well in this case. Many people can agree that this is a real breath of fresh air for what is otherwise a stale genre in the modern gaming sense. It manged to combine the moba and online shooter genre to near-perfect results. There is a progression system but it is only for cosmetic purposes such as alternate costumes voice clips or spray cans. They can be achieved by getting loot boxes which are acquired after leveling up. You can get more through micro transactions which is a shame for a well respected company such as Blizzard but at least it is only for aesthetic purposes and does not affect the game play. I am also surprised that this game does have so many perfect scores eve  though there is pretty minimal content. The maps are small and there are only approximately 3 or 4 game modes. This game could benefit with having more maps and more modes. Single player campaigns are not the priority for these types of games but considering how diverse the cast is and their unique powers it would be interesting to have a story mode which would further explore these characters and the Overwatch lore. Despite these setbacks the game is still a blast to play. Players have accesses to all of the heroes at the start and each of them are unique and play a certain role. No two characters play alike in fact the game outright discourages you from only picking one champion since the heroes are split into the following roles for your team: assault, defense, tank, and support. The characters are not only diverse in their powers but also in their play styles. The controls are the same for each chracter but how they feel is incredibly different. Every champion is fun t play as and the game encourages experimentation to see which ones you are best at and which ones are good at certain maps.   The game also keeps you on your toes because the action is smooth and quick. The pvp is the major highlight of the game as you test your skills against your opponents. The bright and colorful aesthetic is also a nice breath of fresh air after years of multiplayer shooters being in murky grey r brown. The heroes are distinct and the game play will give you an ad reline rush even if you loose as each game feels like a fair challenge instead of having players use cheap tactics to win.

I bought overwatch after hearing it was like the old TF2. In some ways I can see the comparison. I played for around a week, maybe two. I really tried to give the game a chance. But it just feels empty, repetitive, and at the end of the day boring. The community surrounding the game doesn't help much, with people generally not working as a team. This is really unfortunate given Overwatch's team focus.  In the end, I put it on the shelf, thinking \"maybe I'll give it a try again someday down the road.\" I haven't played it since. It has no lasting appeal. The aesthetic wasn't for me, but hey that's subjective.  This game was a waste of money, and I'm disappointed in myself for buying it. Maybe children could enjoy this game, but the sexuality of it kind of stops that to. Teens. That i think is probably the perfect audience for this game. Over all, a very disappointing purchase.

But Oxenfree is a great example of how video games can tell stories - and it uses the objectively most realistic conversation system ever created. The characters uhm and ahh, and the conversation never stops for you - allowing you to cut others off, or keep your silence if you miss your opportunity.  Its story excels in delivering on the choice given to players, and, sure sometimes choice don't matter as much as you want, but more often then not, Oxenfree is far more open than any other similar games (Life is Strange, I'm looking at you), although its short play time and limited mechanics mean I expect that saved dev-time to go somewhere. The player-choice and conversation style make this more a conversation simulator than a walking one. The horror elements make Oxenfree scary and tense without actually having any horror that is directly scary, something that is very well executed. Its ending might feel a bit like a cop-out, but it still feels like less of a disservice than Life is Strange or Infinite, in that its mind **** makes just enough sense to have an emotional impact whilst maintaining a proper character arc for everyone and preserving that I'm-like-85%-sure-whats-going-on effect that permeates the entire game.
