There is no difference between the dps, healer, and tank classes. Balancing is completely abandoned right now. The wraith, assassin, and gunslinger dominate the game, seeing as they do so much damage and they movement speed is a blur. Compare that to a class like the the Juggernaut which has less mobility, less damage, and barely more health it just seems unfair. The pacing is also an issue. The game is a chaotic mess when your in a match. You get no breathing room to recover from a 1v1 or anything. You kill, you die immediately after, they die after killing you, and so on and so forth. It's an endless loop of madness in cramped maps that are too small for fast paced objective missions. There is a game mode where you have to fight for a ball in the middle and bring it to the enemies side to score. The Wraith class can literally (no exaggeration) pick up the ball and be in the enemies base in less than 3 seconds. I promise that is not exaggerated. THAT IS REAL!! half the time i can't keep track of enemies, or my own team and i end up looking around in circles.

Most don\u2019t care for it, however there are some who haven\u2019t heard of it; let alone played it. I want you to take everything you\u2019ve read or heard about this game; good or bad, and those reviews from IGN and Metacritic, and various others need to be thrown out the window for a moment. I\u2019m not discrediting their work by any means. I\u2019m simply stating that those who\u2019ve reviewed it and weren\u2019t phased by this game just didn\u2019t give it a solid chance, nor immerse themselves into it. I\u2019ve never played a game in my life that\u2019s given me anxiety the way this one does, and I\u2019ve played them all; from the very first Resident Evil as a kid, to Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro\u2019s P.T. (The Playable Teaser for Silent Hills) back in 2014. Let it be known right now that I haven\u2019t finished the game. I can\u2019t. I am mentally having a hard time moving the protagonist any further. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want to, no, it\u2019s because my mind won\u2019t let me. To me that says this game has done its job. Layers of Fear is a psychological horror that, without you realizing it, plays on your innermost fears, and in a weird sort of way it brings them to life. I\u2019ve spent the most of an entire month attempting to make it through this game. I never finished it, now here we are in May, and I still can\u2019t finish. I walk around that corridor in what seems to be an endless loop, over and over again. Until finally I make it around the wall and notice that everything\u2019s changed. Books are scattered all across the floor as I keep moving, and I make it around that bend again, and this time there\u2019s a bloody couch which has the words \u201cGoing in Circles\u201d written on it. The light goes dark, and the door to my left opens up. I see a silhouette moving from inside the room that I haven\u2019t walked in front of yet. Whatever it is is in a rocking chair, and the maddening squeak only confirms my fear. The game wants me to see what\u2019s inside. But I don\u2019t want to see what\u2019s inside. So I pause the game. I take a few deep breaths and try to move toward the door. I still can\u2019t. I pause the game again, take a sip of my coffee, and try once more. I inch forward ever slightly, looking around the room in the game, hoping that when I turn around, something will be in front of me to kill me and just end it. It doesn\u2019t happen.I have to face that fear and move forward. Nothing still. I decide it\u2019s time to get up and write a review on the game because I\u2019m too afraid to actually keep playing. Layers of Fear has done its job. Layers of Fear is about an artist; more specifically an anonymous painter who has seemingly lost his mind trying to create the perfect masterpiece. Only this masterpiece is done with more than just paint. The story itself is gripping enough to keep you playing, or at the very least, keep you trying to play. You want to continue to know what happens next in the game most people would label \u201cWalking Simulator\u201d. That is, if you can keep walking.

I created an account just to write this review.  After playing this game since release, I can assure you that is is the most miserable, glitchy, cruel, cheap-death, grind fest of a terrible game to ever exist. EVER. This is NOT free-to-play Dark Souls, and don't listen to anyone that tells you that. This game does everything it can to try and get you to spend money, from charging you ingame currency for deaths and check-points, to not letting you organize your inventory so you can never tell why it's so full all the time.  (Buy death metals to revive, buy premium passes to use check points for free, and also buy more death metals to expand your storage-all for real money!)  The better your equipment is, the more expensive it is, BUT it breaks faster! You will grind for weeks just to advance in the game and experience a couple of hours of actual game play.  Yes, actual weeks of grinding to play for 2 hours!  Then the game will let another player's character into your game-someone who has more time than you, and has weapons and armor from further in the game that you don't have access to. That player's character will surprise one-shot you and it will take hours to grind out the hundreds of thousands of dollars in game currency to get your character back (again, unless you want to pay real money to revive.) Also, over half of the quests in the game, specifically the ones that offer the best rewards, are glitched and cannot be completed.  Oh, and you can't ever save in game money.  The second you're slightly above being broke, other players invade your base and steal it all, and there's nothing you can do about it-at all.  You can place your own characters as defenders, but their AI is (by design, I assume) horrible. Other players make quick work of AI characters, whom they then kidnap-stripping your AI defenders of all of their gear, which you then have to repurchase with ingame currency (get ready to grind more!) It is so unworth it to guard your base because of this, that most people don't bother to defend their bases at all and everyone just makes sure they have nearly no cash at all times.

The game is a free to play game on the Playstation Store yet it excessively pushes microtransactions that break the game. Let It Die tries to play like a rogue like Dark Souls style game. I personally detest the Souls series and find them broken by their extreme difficulty that prevents the games from every being fun. Let It Die is easier than the Souls games which is definitely a plus because it made the experience much more enjoyable. The game plays like a hack and slash game where players are tasked to climb to the top of a tall tower full of dungeons and enemies. The game tells an interesting premise that I found quite interesting but sadly the story never gets very far. The characters in the game such as the Grim Reaper called Uncle Death are funny and quirky and really added to the experience. The graphics I found decent but nothing spectacular. The artstyle is certainly interesting but dungeon layouts and textures are often copy and pasted throughout the game. Let It Die has a great gameplay concept but it fails in execution. Since the game is free to play the Devs tried to find ways to force the player to buy microtransactions that revive the player after being killed. The bosses and enemies in the game often use cheap unfair moves that kill the player in one hit forcing you to use a revive the character or scrap it completely. I personally do not like rogue like games and find them gimmicky. Forcing the player to start all over again is annoying and not the least bit fun. The player gets to create their own fighters to climb the top of the tower. The armor and weapons in this game are great and feel satisfactory to use. The only problem with the weapons and armor in this game is the fact they break quite easily forcing the player to constantly changes weapons and armor in the middle of battle. The game controls are also very clunky and lead to unfair deaths as well. The game is built around precise combat yet the controls are too imprecise for any of this to work. Another problem Let It Die has in its combat is the fact that the once the player is hit by an attack from the enemy it becomes impossible to dodge until the enemy finishes its moves. This can also cause more unfair deaths. Despite this the combat can be fun and addicting making each blow the player makes feel crunchy and real. The game also features another annoying rogue like element that if the player does not save on the ground level of the tower the game will kill the player and force the player the player to use a new character. I found this very strange because instead of allowing the player to use a revive the game forces the player to start from scratch which I found extremely frustrating. Eventually I had no choice but to quit because of this mechanic. The revives in this game are called \u201cdeath medals\u201d and the player is given a few for free to start off with. The game will occasionally reward the player with these in the game but they are very rare. Once you run out of death medals the game will ask the player to either buy more death medals using real life money from the Playstation Store or start from scratch. At first I payed the cheap 99 cents for 10 death medals but they quickly ran out the higher I climbed the tower. The game forces you to stop buy elevators and pull a switch so you can return to that spot on the tower. I eventually got very far up and found no elevators for many floors until I had to log off. When I logged back in I was not given the option to revive my character and was forced to create a new character to climb the tower. I lost all my progress from the last climb where I climbed over 5 floors. The character I had was maxed leveled so I attempted to climb to the top but my character was swiftly killed on my way back up by a boss who used a cheap one hit kill ability I couldn\u2019t dodge. When I faced this boss with my other character the boss never used this ability until now and repeatedly did it to my other character making me eventually run out of death medals. When I saw if I could purchase more death medals for 99 cents but found that I had to pay over $10 for more death medals. After this I decided to give up realizing I was wasting my time. For a game that sells itself on being \u201cfree to play\u201d Let It Die is a very expensive game to play if you plan on completing it. Overall Let It Die has a great vision but fails in execution due to its janky combat and forced in microtransactions. I would not recommend playing this game at all but if you insist on playing it I would advise playing until you run out of your starter death medals. The only reason why I am giving it a 3 is because the game despite having many flaws had a great concept that I believe could have been fully realized if the combat and level design were refined and the game was made more fair and not oriented around forcing the player to spend money."], ["Nel", "User", "1", "I wanted to like this game, but the way it forces you to grind, they should have renamed it to let it grind.

That said, Before the Storm's first episode feels very flat. I feel a bit of compassion for the writing team, as they're really in a corner here. The whole point of an RPG is usually to give a degree of control over a character and their story. Unfortunately, in this case we already know where the story leads and who the characters are. Thus, it's a bit bewildering to me why they've chosen to both A.) Make this a prequel and B.) Really double down on the narrative side. There are no new gameplay features to be found, other than graffiti, which is just a photo replacement, and the argument system, which doesn't do much. And story wise, this episode is sorely lacking. There's nothing to really drive it along, other than the teenage angst which very few honestly enjoyed in the first outing, and the relationship between Chloe and Rachel; which returning players already know the ending to.  Honestly, going forward I'm not sure where the story wants to go, either. So far it has just gone through the motions, and I can't really say that it's worth any monetary or emotional investment. I'm hoping for an upswing in the coming episodes, but as of right now; the free first episode of Life is Strange gave us so much more than the paid episode of Before the Storm. The only really saving grace so far is the once again brilliant soundtrack, both in the original numbers and the real world artists, it shines. I'm hoping that episode two brings something new and exciting to the table.

The game opens with a concert, introducing the player to the general gameplay of Life is Strange: Before the Storm. Similar to a point-and-click adventure game, in every area Chloe can walk around and interact with random objects, most of them with very little significance until she interacts with the right object and the story progresses. The issue with this comes with the fact that there is no flow to any of the conversations, and can lead to extreme examples of ludo-narrative dissonance while in a supposedly tense conversation, there can be five minute pauses where the player thinks of what to say. The pacing of the story is too easily disrupted without the player doing anything in order to disrupt it. The illusion of reality is too easily shattered, and the player doesn't even have to do anything to break it. The backtalk challenges fix this by adding a timer, however, even by fixing the unnatural pacing of the conversations, the game reveals another flaw: the dialogue. The performances are passable, for example I think Chloe's voice actor despite not having a lot to work with did a decent job of capturing the voice of a the apathetic, unhappy, shallow character Chloe is. Which leads to the flaw that Chloe and her interactions with the other characters lack emotional weight and any sort of reliability, because all the characters and relationships are all very surface-level. While understanding that Chloe is not necessarily meant to be likable, the way she interacts with the different objects in the world certainly reinforce her bitterness and her frame of mind, they never expand upon her character beyond reiterating that she is unhappy. The player never learns how her mind works, or how she approaches situations other than that she approaches them from a cynical point of view, and that is it. It's not fun to play as this character because it is impossible to understand how she thinks, and therefore getting engaged with her plight is borderline impossible. For example, the player does not learn anything by clicking on the objects in David's garage. Chloe simply restates that she hates David until the player decides to progress the story. She has no emotional connection with any character besides Rachel and to an extent David, so it isn't just Chloe who feels shallow, it's the world around her, and almost every character in the game. The dialogue, like the first game, is out of touch and unnecessarily forced. The reason the slang in Life is Strange feels so unnatural is because even to the people this game is aimed towards, it ages very quickly. Now especially, things become outdated faster than ever, and by putting references to internet culture into their game, Dontnod is ensuring that the older this game gets, the worse its biggest flaw will be. Before the end of this review, I want to note that the symbolism between this game and the Tempest is an interesting touch. For as much as I dislike this episode, it does have its appeal. I understand why people enjoy watching Chloe and Rachel's relationship evolve while it is still fresh, and I feel as though this is the best the game gets in terms of visuals. So I'm going to give Life is Strange: Before the Storm Episode 1 a 4 out of 10."], ["Griffin44", "User", "3", "Boring as **** Extremely unlikable main character, and not to mention you can't lose.

A set of cool optional side-quests involving pictures really made me want to explore and experiment with the environment.  However, the actual meat of the game, its story, is awful.  For some reason Square Enix can't decide if it wants to do a murder mystery, a coming-of-age tale, or a sitcom, and ends up doing none of them very well.

I will admit that comparing it to Dark Souls is pretty unfair, but even on its own, this game is a little (Though not super) below average.  Combat feels clunky, and the enemies have very large health bars in compensation for interesting attack patterns.

Even the core mechanics are decent, but it's just very obvious the lack of polish put into the game.  So, is this game worth it?  On sale for under $5 I'd say, if you're a Dark Souls fan, that is.

The graphics and gothic fantasy artwork are constantly beautiful. The atmosphere is full. The combat is thrilling with a real sense of pressure and strategy. This is not a button masher. It's ridiculous to call it that. I'm really enjoying the game. It's a dark and fun campaign. Like Shadows of Mordor, I'll likely get a good 15 hours or so of campaign and sides, without much replayability though. The thing I like the most about this game is the great variety of combat. Lots of techniques and loot to try out and learn from. The variety of enemy behavior however is not so great. Also there can be some glitches and bugs, but the few I experienced were pretty minimal. There could be more story, enemies, and locations. There could be more to it. But it is fun and it has a great atmosphere.

When I compare these two games, I can say that they have improved certain elements of gameplay, and added some new ones, for example: Vulcosuits Armor and an improved ATB system. Vulcosuits Armor can be used on field and in battle. On field, it helps you remove certain obstacles that prevent you from exploring the map, while in battle it helps you to do more damage to enemy, which can be useful when you are fighting against the boss. The most I like in this game is the battle system. The new ATB system is very interesting because they have added more strategic elements and is more active. The story of this game is good and interesting. Through the story you follow the adventures of Kanata and his friends. In their adventures, they face many challenges and must restore the Lost to save the world.
