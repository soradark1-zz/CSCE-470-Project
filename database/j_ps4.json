As I progressed through the game, I found myself so in the moment all the way through and I didn't want to stop playing, and when I finally got to the end, I was almost sad that it was over.

For those looking for a meaningful and unforgettable experience, play it. not to say the game play isn't good, it adds a lot to the game, very relaxing and feels very natural, but its not the reason the game is so good. The reason this game is so great is because of how well it evokes emotions with such a simple story and game mechanics, relying on its visuals and the context of the player's role within the world.

I don't think everyone is going to necessarily get what I got out of this game, because the enjoyment of this game is completely based on how much the game resonates with you.

Also, the load times are pretty long.  I've been playing JC3 in the mornings and can scarf down breakfast in the time it takes to load the game from the start screen.  It becomes a bigger hassle when retrying a challenge - it's enough to make me give up on the challenge altogether rather than wait.  I hope they have a way of patching this because the game is outrageously fun.

The wingsuit is a good example: You see the map was designed for distance for the wingsuit to glide from one side to the other whereas JC2's map was designed for the parachute which hasn't been toned down in this game but rather ignored. Because of how much the parachute was used in JC2 they assumed that adding another traveling mechanic in the same fashion would add brownie points but it sort feels weird.

Initially, the game shines - missions are interesting, there are a variety of new challenges and a few new features, but these quickly give way to outrageously difficult story missions and a painful fast travel and resupply system.  I understand that the developers may have wanted to make the game a little more challenging than JC2, which simply allowed you to drop a helicopter or jet right in front of you at any time, but their new \"beacon\" system means you only get one resupply before having to traipse perhaps tens of kilometers back to the nearest city you liberated to get more.  The real issue here is once the story progresses past the initial island grouping in which you find yourself, you end up on a large island that has about half the content but is more than three times the size - villages and military bases are anywhere from 5 to 30 kilometers away, and many mountain ranges block your way.

The Wing gliding is insanely difficult to even master the basic mechanics of it without face planting to your death a hundred times over, and the vehicles you use during races have such sensitive suspension hitting a small rock can send you air born.

It is oodles of fun to pick up and relax with, for there are virtually no limits. Surprisingly enough, I like this game more than JC2. Just Cause 2 was great, but had problems with some repetitive missions, a terrible problem with de-spawning vehicles that you order, and a pretty much useless grapple tether that broke whenever you tried to pull something (at least in the PS3 version) but other than that, JC2 was a blast to play with a huge, beautiful world and loads of stuff to blow up. Just Cause 3 does that and more. JC3 is innovative over JC2 in it's own right, for JC3 has introduced us to the Wingsuit, which is a blast to play with, and the multiple grapple tethers with retract function allows for limitless possibilities for causing chaos. The story isn't anything special, in fact, its a little worse than Just Cause 2, but by no means does the story bog down the experience. People new to the JC series need to understand that you should go in expecting a game, not a cinematic, immersive story. Gamers and critics alike who write the game off as mediocre because of a bad story have little imagination when it comes to games, and need to get through any game with a strong story. I also see some people saying that the world isn't detailed, which is completely false. JC3's map has so much more depth to it than JC2. There are numerous cliffs and caves, and huge mountains to explore. Here in JC3, you don't need a story, all you need is your parachute and wingsuit, unlimited C4, varied and creative weapons, and explosions to have a great time as you're dropped into this massive, beautiful map."], ["indigobeast", "User", "7", "Just cause 3 is actually not that bad for a game like it is.

But there is one thing the game has failed terribly at doing, THE DRIVING MECHANICS!

My biggest gripes with open-world games are their focus on story at the cost of gameplay. A very nice example of this is the Witcher 3's story, which, because it is so emotionally driven, requires constant attention. If the player decides they want to explore the world more or put more focus on the side content of the game instead of following the main quest for the majority of their playtime, the pacing of the story is broken and the magic is ruined. No matter how good that side content is, the story and main quest is ruined because the sense of emergency and realism is ruined. On the other hand, if they player decides to follow the story and ignore most of the side content, they will be unprepared for the more difficult moments of the story, and as a result their experience will contain a lot of harsh difficulty spikes. Furthermore, their experience will be a very limited one, as they are only following this one path in a sea of branching paths. In my opinion, the best open-world games purposefully create an environment where anything the player does feels like the right thing to be doing. Everything feeds into the experience instead of being their own separate entities. That is why, despite the universal criticism of it, I desperately wanted to like Just Cause 3, and in some ways I do. I like the amount of freedom the player is given from the very beginning of the game despite the fact that not everything is unlocked, which gave me the impression that this game was confident in its world for entertainment, and that gave me hope that the game would use its environment and its world to always keep things fresh. I like the movement mechanics, because the variety of ways to traverse the world allowed familiar areas to feel fresh. The movement on the ground, by contrast, feels restrictive and stiff by comparison. For example, it's weird that the game doesn't allow Rico to scope. I get that it was going for the 'arcade-style shooter vibe, but then why do the guns all have limited ammo? If their ammo was infinite, but the reload times were made more extensive, I may have overlooked this, but to me this minor flaw is a little jarring. The explosion effects are obviously pretty, if only because they're so over the top. The loading screens start acceptably, as they never break the flow to an unforgivable extent and mostly stay below forty-five seconds each, however they seem to increase in time throughout the game, and by the end go for a minute and a half. Another persistent flaw is how unpolished the game feels. In thirty hours, this game crashed about seven times, each of which signaled the end of a play session for me, which brings me to the most egregious part of the game: it cannot keep my attention. Despite the fun superhero-esque movement controls and expanse of beautiful fields, everything in this game is exactly what has already been seen. The environments are very bare in terms of variation, ninety percent of the environments are fields and snowy mountains. Sometimes the layout of the environment changes, which can really keep the game fresh, but that is all the game does to demonstrate its varied locals. Compare this to Horizon: Zero Dawn or Breath of the Wild. In both of these games there were a variety of environments, each with their own effects, enemies, and hazards. In Just Cause 3, there's no purpose in exploring because all there is to find is enemy camps and more fields. Despite the initial promise of an open-world game with focus on the world itself, exploring gets dull very fast. There's nothing to find and nothing but repetitive missions to do. This would be excusable if the main story was fun to follow, but almost every single mission ends up using the same mechanics, and instead of using the wingsuit, most of the missions use either the mediocre driving controls, or the simplistic shooting mechanics. Despite the fun that can be had through grappling up mountains or soaring through the skies, Just Cause 3 tries to place its focus on a world without variety, and as a result the whole game lacks variety as well, so I'm going to give Just Cause 3 a 4 out of 10."], ["ElKoala", "User", "4", "les invito a comprarse just cause 2, porque este no lo vale. lo obtuve gratis y solo por eso puedo entregar una critica, sino dudo que lo hubiese comprado solo con ver gameplays... pero si quires comprar este juego, te recomiendo primero buscar en youtube explosiones belicas, porque seguramente ser\u00e1 lo mismo que el propio juego."], ["user12", "User", "9", "This games is incredibly underrated.

Even right from the start, you can explore the entire map. No invisible walls, no boundaries, just a vast, limitless world of 400 square miles, waiting to be explored. Exploring is also fun, with the help of the wingsuit and grappling hook.
