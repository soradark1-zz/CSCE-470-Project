Running at 60 FPS, the action is as smooth as should be expected, details are gorgeous, and the game is more responsive than it has ever been.  Owning all the tables on nearly every available platform, I can say this gives my high end gaming PC a run for the money while playing the Steam versions.  3d capabilities have not been tested yet; however, if they are as solid as they were on PS3 (aside from some minor convergence issues) the tables should display marvelously given a quality display.  Ignore complaints of being charged with tables... is this not the trend anymore?  Zen has followed this model for years, and this should be expected as such.  Certainly you will get a table for free, but they provide quality demos of each table for individuals to make their own decisions and pay for the ones the choose.  Beyond that, the tables are loosely inspired by real world tables, and carry some elements of love from their reality based counterparts, though they may not be recognizable to a younger generation.  The physics are getting better, but this is more of a fantasy simulation pinball.  If you are expecting anything more, than look to Pinball Arcade, a worthy mention replicating real tables.  Zen has managed to produce Pinball tables that have great rule sets, awesome challenges, and offer hours of fun, depth, skill development, and will rank you on leaderboards.  Seriously, Zen tables run about $3.00 a table.  In my experience, that is $3.00 of happiness.  Not all tables are winners, that's why they offer demos, but there's bound to be a table that everyone who claims to be a pinball fan can enjoy.  Why are you still reading...?   Give Zen a whirl, and try a table or two.  At the end of the day, you will have likely spent more money on your lunch, coffee, or some App on a phone you may hardly use.

With that said, this game is a decent/good but not close to great game. What this game does right is the feel of it. What I mean by that is, it's silent, it's dark and the sound and background noise make it a tense experience. Mix that with the fact that the infected are difficult to kill and can pop out around any corner, this is quite a suspense filled game. The story itself is pretty decent as well, but your character is basically a meaningless John doe opposed to controlling a character with his own path and story. What makes this game good as well is the strategic approach you must take to every mission, and the scarcity of weapon ammunition. You can choose to bring a ton of flares and mines to destroy zombie hordes quickly, or you could hack zombies one by one repeatedly or waste ammunition on them. You have safe houses to unlock as well as shortcuts to unlock to escape to safe houses quickly. Through out your playthrough you learn the ability to lock pick, upgrade your scanner/pad so you can scan/hack secured doors, use your scanner to spot infected, doors, and survival tools, etc.. plenty of good to this game especially the fact that if you are killed by the infected, you respawn in your safe house as a new character and have the option to move on in the story and find new inventory or go back to where you died, kill your zombified old self and get your equipment back. Now.. With all that I pointed out, I gave this game a 7 due in large part to graphics and hand to hand combat as a whole. Graphics are definitely not next gen and are very dated, and killing even the average infected can take 10 hits to the head when it should take 3 at most.. what makes it worse is that even firearms can be underpowered, as I've had moments where I shot an infected in the head 3 times and it kept coming. Only way to kill infected efficiently is to stock up on explosives, flares and shotgun ammo. This game is not the greatest game, but it certainly isn't bad at all. Combat and graphics aren't very good but the tense atmosphere, dim lighting, and overall sound and feel of this game is definitely survival/horror that has been missing in gaming over the years.

The story mode alone have basically 15 levels of 4 player Co-Op fun with excellent 70's exploitation music in the background. 5 additional HORDE mode maps and you've got yourself hours and hours of zombie killing fun with your buddies."], ["johnbman11", "User", "9", "I saw a random video of this a few months back and totally forgot about it. Then BAM! the PSN shows this as a new game for only $39.99. Did a little research (gameplay/feedback), and made the purchase. This is a surprisingly fun game! It plays surprisingly smooth and is a lot of fun with co-op. I'd definitely recommend it! They're ported games so the graphics aren't anything to write home about but they are still pretty good seeing as how they came from the PC platform."], ["Fastback69Stang", "User", "10", "This is easily one of the coolest games I have played in a long, long time from a purely fun and atmospheric standpoint. It just has this amazing vibe. Evil Dead Nazis would be a good way to describe it. Expect the unexpected in a high action horror game with incredible atmosphere. Think Sniper Elite and Return to Castle Wolfenstein crossed with something like Evil Dead. It is totally it's own animal. The game has co op and Horde Mode ."], ["Jamezlap", "User", "10", "This is a really good game wthat is specially for Co-op. The game is fun and challenging you really need to be close to your teammates because there's hundreds of zombies trying to kill you at once! Not only that but also the type of zombies are really unique, every zombie has something special where you need to do different tactics to win. Story mode is more like a left 4 dead type (which is fun) and horde is even better because you can stay hours and hours with your team surviving and killing zombies. The game art design is beautiful and you can really appreciate this with the 60 FPS. This game is one good Zombie survival game. 10/10"], ["WORDSof1K", "User", "9", "This game is awesome! Let me be serious for a moment though and say that this game brings some great things to the table. Is it worth $50? Yes. You get three decent long campaigns with a for sure replay value. The Horde mode is just delicious fun and gets very challenging. The addition of the bullet cam from sniper elite series, yes I know this game is tied into the series, makes every shot feel like an amazing experience."], ["Thegodfatherson", "User", "7", "Rebellion's LEFT 4 DEAD clone, makes for fun but in limited amounts. ZAT is just Sniper Elite V2, but with nazi zombies and co-op multiplayer. The graphics are gorgeous, Trilogy shows out the next gen consoles, with a dark tone. It looks better than Sniper Elite 3 on the PS4. Rebellion shoves the exact same gameplay in Zombie Army Trilogy, but adds some extras to it. The multiplayer is to DIE for, it recreates the fun we had in L4D by multiply that with nazi zombies and crazy fun game modes. But, the same tedious shooting and ideas are shoved into this package, and for a 60 dollar price tag, it doesn't fully realize the great potental Rebellion ignores ever so often. But it is a damn fun game, and one that I will be getting back to soon. Without the washed out ideas, Zombie Army Trilogy would be a game that changes co-op multiplayer forever."], ["kenmil", "User", "4", "Too lazy to develop new maps and make this a real game, the developers have just continued on from Sniper Elite, complete with the familiar glitches. This game is repetitious and ridiculously difficult in patches, but only through the sheer weight of numbers that come at you. Nothing clever, original or really entertaining in this, and the levels of gore are just over the top."], ["ericjover", "User", "10", "I own Nazi Zombie 1 and 2 on PC, and getting the entire trilogy on PS4 was a no brainer since many of my friends are on console.   The Zombie Army Trilogy quenched my thirst for zombie annihilation after being let down by CoD:AW Havoc zombie mode and all the other piss poor zombie shooters in the market."], ["Bigbabysweetz", "User", "8", "This game is great! I Takes what COD does with zombies and gave it a more dark and disturbing feel too it. What is really the cherry on the top are the kill cams in this game. Making a fantastic shot slows down time and you can see your well placed shot pierce the organs of zombies. Might sound weird but once you watch a quick video of it you will know what im talking about.  Its a Co-OP game, and a ABSOLUTE blast to play with friends and just kinda hangout and make jokes. Only thing that is wrong is there is not a active community. Might get repetitive fast and for 50 dollars might not be worth it. i would buy the game again and happy with the purchase."], ["RETROBOTER", "User", "7", "Graphic: 7/10"], ["ZombieHunter93", "User", "9", "This is easily one of the most enjoyable Zombie games I have played in a long time. In a market that has become increasingly saturated over the years, mostly due to the ongoing popularity of Call of Duty's Zombie modes, it is refreshing to play something that feels so balls out ridiculous and designed purely for enjoyment. There are no deep metaphors about the state of the human race, no morally ambiguous choices to make, just waves and waves of Zombie scum to obliterate in any means you deem fit. Don't get me wrong, there is definitely a place for a deeper exploration of the Zombie theme in gaming, but it's just so refreshing to see something deviate so whole heartedly from that and pull it off without just seeming like a stupid cash in."], ["akus_1985", "User", "8", "My favorite aspect of Zombie Army Trilogy (ZAT) is the soundtrack. While many contemporary games either downplay or misuse music, ZAT nearly always uses music to its full advantage to create a unique atmosphere, that sounds and feels like it was ripped straight out of an 80's horror film in the style of John Carpenter. This game truly separates itself from its contemporaries with its incredible vibe, and horror-themed motif. There are around 12 stages and they are rather long and feel varied enough to not get stale. Despite the level you choose, you'll always be shooting, blowing up, and kicking an incredible amount of zombies. And, as repetitive as that sounds, it really isn't because ZAT offers a healthy amount of strategy while slaying the undead. Well placed trip wires, mounted guns, and explosive canisters can be utilized at the right moments to destroy multiple zombies at one time, and the difficulty can be adjusted for a more arcade based or realistic experience while sniping. Turning up the zombie count is amusing as well, albeit it usually makes the game impossible if turned up too high. The weaponry feels varied enough as far as I'm concerned. You'll most likely find a combination you like, and stick with it. The character selection is ample, but they play exactly the same as far as I can tell. They are only different cosmetically. The graphics aren't anything special, but they get the job done. The game shines, or doesn't actually, when it uses shadows and light contrast to its advantage. Seeing the silhouettes of zombies slowly approaching you hundreds of feet away in a subway that is harshly lit is an amazing sight. Similarly, witnessing shadows of a horde engulf a nearby hallway, builds incredible tension, and works astoundingly well when accompanied with the fore-mentioned soundtrack. Despite the tantalizing atmosphere, the game does have some occasional frame rate drops (more so in multiplayer) that detract from the overall experience. Thankfully, the technical issues aren't persistent enough to spoil an otherwise enjoyable experience. If this game flew under your radar when it was released, and you are a fan of retro-horror, do yourself and buy this unique game. I don't even typically like shooters all that much, especially the Call of Duty franchise, but this is a very different experience. ZAT is certainly an anomaly, and its a shame it won't be played by most gamers, because it's a great game that breathes some fresh air into a stale genre"]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "Xbox One"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/72d5e592ee926223cb5db12eb3133f96.jpg"}
