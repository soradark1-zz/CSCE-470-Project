And don't take that as a bad thing; the co-op and race levels are ingeniously designed, providing a great couch experience.

Instead, they spent their money on an awesome techno soundtrack that helps players such as myself groove along to the gripping, tough-as-nails platforming, as well as everything else I will mention here. The controls of N++ are super smooth, and the way you handle N (and the way N handles edges; I mean, wow!) helps the controller disappear, leaving only the player, and the perfect platformer.

No quick passing (instead \"flashy passing\", which is slower and results in turnovers about 1/3 of the time), convoluted (even more, forget about franchise, you'll spend most of your time tapping X to get through simulated owner conversations...ludicrous, and then trying to \"earn\" tokens to unlock basic features) interface and menus, player jerseys that dance to the beat for some modern (anti) family related reason (maybe NBA starting squads are actually doing synchronized pec-flexes and I just missed the TNT segment, or maybe it's just a programming glitch, IDK...yeah right!), and complete crap-shoot gameplay..players pass up or miss wide open jumpers, lay-ups, dunks, passes and lanes to the basket about ten times more often than not. How a game can be both so technical and so garbage at the same time makes your brain hurt. I'm looking forward to receiving my copy of LIVE 14, which does look disappointing visually, especially for a game 4 years in development essentially, but if the game play is even 25% better than 2K (or even as good as LIVE 09 or 10...with updated rosters) I won't be disappointed. To me the whole NBA2K vs (or lack of) NBA Live and MADDEN vs (or lack of) NFL2K symbolizes everything that is wrong with our \"capitalism won the cold war\" society...EA hasn't had to complete with anyone, for going on a decade, with a gridiron football game, and as such Madden hasn't been good, and has gotten consistently worse since about 2005, and 2K hasn't had to compete with anyone for almost half a decade, hence NBA2K is all style and no substance (Humanity has been so hollowed out...over 1 MILLION dead Iraqi civilians or 48 hours from the start of NUCLEAR ARMAGEDDON in Syria last summer can't compete with Janet Jackson's flabby TIT-TAY or Miley Cyrus's flat BOOT-TAY...PATHETIC)...AND almost no one can even see that although the graphics are good (...her face is pretty/she used to have a body, lol...and her brother might not have ever touch a child beyond a hug, and they just tried to assassinate his character and then his life literally, because he tried to tell us what was up...just JFK, MLK, and RFK...when will you wake up, or do you prefer these digital dreams?...don't Imagine Dragons, imagine Jack Kennedy's brain alchemically transformed into red mist and scaled up to 4K courtesy of Sony Corp. and Mr. Zapruder...and the CIA with some old school video editing...or don't bother imagining because they're both real...just like the fact that there was a documented bullet hole on the windshield of Kennedy's limo and a hundred other things proving a second (and probably third, fourth filfth shooter and dragons) are real (and while we're at it, the TWIN TOWERS' neighbor, BUILDING 7, reached 100% of FREEFALL VELOCITY on Sept L-Eventh, proving that, due the fact that it had 84 structural columns and 2 or 3 nearly burnt out fires, it was DEMOLISHED, meaning it was AN INSIDE JOB...do a little mental experiment on that, and then on the bigger thing...that Kennedy's death and the events on that day about a dozen years ago must have been orchestrated by folks who claim to be \"your government\" mean for what sort of world you actually find yourself breathing in...for the time being, mean), there is no substance. Furthermore, from what I have read, 2K has basically made their basketball game online only...even for OFFLINE modes with an after the fact patch which conflicts with contractual claims published on the package, this wallows in lameness. As a gamer (though it is just a game, $60+ buys a lot of chicken feed, relatively speaking), I wouldn't mind seeing EA get back 'in the game' with regard to basketball sims and 2K get back in the game of American football...when there's competition, everybody wins (well, at least 99% of us do, lol...puck the one purse scent), better yet, let there be 3 or more major sports game producers (just like political parties), then perhaps the stale (slave) mate would be broken.

Also, team mates would allow the ball being pass to go off their hands and give you a turnover for your own player.

It seems 2k is following the absurd f2p system of making it hard to intice you to pay real money to level up, so it becomes quite frustrating as the season progresses. The other bad is the online DRM and is why I dropped the game's score this much. The online DRM causes problems in your menu system that you can't access if the 2k servers are down or you are having problems with your internet.

It isn't just about playing the games and racking up as many triple-doubles as you can anymore. If you're a douchebag off the court it will correlate directly with how your teammates treat you in game situations, among other things. Some events are quite clearly scripted though and have the tendency to occur at the most inopportune moments. Cutscenes dealing with injuries and/or arguments with the referees always seem to take place when you're on a roll in the middle of a heated game. You get taken out or ejected and your team ends up losing...nice. There was another instance in which my player (FT rating of 95) choked away 2 free throws at the line with a few seconds left that cost me a game, just to activate a cutscene where a teammate calls me out and says that I need to shoot 50 FTs at the next practice. Your experience should be relative to your own skillset and how you play, rather than being quite obviously rigged to stay in line with a linear path. Other than that, progressing your player and seeing him develop has that allure that keeps you playing. One thing that I will say is that once your player becomes REALLY good it becomes way too easy to win games which can churn out some unrealistic results. I play for the Sacramento Kings- not a good team by any stretch of the imagination, yet we have won 24 consecutive games and counting.

The CPU have gotten more aggressive, more magnetizing, and flat out annoying. It's like the CPU players can't miss no shots at all. They can get to the basket without hesitation. And it seems like 2K just took a complete huge crap on MyCareer. Everything has kept happening and I couldn't stop anyone from making shots. It's like there is no kind of user defense for me in this game. I kept losing games back to back. I couldn't redeem myself from none of those games. It's like 2K is really forcing you to losing a lot of games to make their stupid story mode continue. That is the most disgusting thing I have  ever encountered. 2K always say they are going to keep making the games better and better, but they always keep slipping up and making things worst then ever. I've upgraded my players attributes, but i'll like nothing will not click. Driving to the basket is impossible for me and not only that, I can't make a damn layup. Now what kind of horse S#^T is that. Let's face it, 2K will never admit the issues that they see in the game, but we can. Am I the only one that is highly upset about all the player movements, mechanics and A.I. MyCareer sucks so much balls, that this makes NBA 2K12 second worst, and now I can put this next to 2K12. If they don't have a patch to fix everything in this game, This will be considered to most awful, unplayable game in 2K history. This is my full on full option."], ["Tbell1122", "User", "6", "Personally I think this is a step back from last year.

It is true we have lots of customizable settings and slides to make it be more \"realistic\" but then, when you want to play against other players is hard to get to an agreement about which settings to use...

The defense is really improved although there is still some sliding by the cpu. MyCareer is a blast and i love the cut scenes. I also like how you have ten day contracts instead of getting picked in the draft. The way you level up your player is a big improvement. Instead of buying signature skills you get badges which you earn from playing mycareer. This eliminates people being able to buy vc and have a maxed out player as soon as they get the game, you actually have to play your career to get your player maxed out. It also doesn't feel like 2K is forcing you to buy VC like i felt like they were in 2K14 for ps3. You can earn vc really fast if you play on high difficulty. 2K15 has turned out really nice but there are a few things i didn't like which is why i didn't give a 9 or a 10. First is the music. There are a lot of terrible songs in the game. Please don't allow pharrell to pick the music anymore. And also the server errors which happen every year. I wish 2K would have the servers up and running from the start. Every year we grab the game early and end up not able to play because of server issues.

The realism and attention to player abilities make it very authentic. The features are incredible and also allow you to play NBA 2k15 the way you want. It is very possible to buy 2k15 and the only NBA game you will have to play is that Spurs vs Heat opening game that everybody was stuck on. The My Player section of the game makes you pick a team but you don't have to even play a game. If the My Park is your thing then you can have fun with that for the whole year till 2k16 comes out. The one thing that kept me from giving this game a 10 is the amount of thought that goes into playing defense. The tools to play great defense it there but it sometimes feels like no matter what you do the cpu will figure out a way to do what they want anyway. That doesn't sound like a bad thing at all but in terms of seeing your game plan or play call work is 50/50. The first game I played was the Lakers at the Cavs. I played with Cleveland. This game was test to see how Kobe would play in this game. I was right about what was going to happen. He barely missed any shots even with hands in his face and it was like anything around the basket contested or not was going in. I even rotated double teams towards him on the drive and decided to pressure him before he got the ball so he would move around more and that didn't work. He just cut to the basket and got the ball anyway. That is my one gripe about the game.

This mode starts out with as usual the creation of your player you can  2K scan your face on to your player which gives you pretty decent results on your actual face then on to your position, height, wing-span and etc. We Start out with three High School games where we were able to choose which high school we wanted in the creation.With Cut Scenes introducing the story of a player they call \"FREQ\" we will be playing. \"FREQ\" is given in the story a black sister and light skin best friend with two black parents UNCHANGEABLE with 2K being a worldwide game i am sure not everyone is gonna be a black player nevertheless even a american player which is completely unrealistic on Spike Lee's Part. Throughout the mode there a overwhelming supply of cheesy and some realistic cut scenes.filled.

There are some nice new features in this game like league expansion in MyGM and MyLeague but the gameplay has been ruined. Fouls are completely out of control.

Fastbreaks have been ruined to try to force you to play more halfcourt offense. The AI players will not run in front of you in transition and almost always stop at the three point line even if they have terrible three point shooting stats. The substitution menu is much harder to use than in previous years but once you get used to it, it isn't all that bad. Also, VC is much harder to use this year as part of EA's never ending conquest to take as much money from their fans as possible.

How can you release a video game without allowing the users to skip the cut scenes when they just want to play instead of having to wait through irrelevant things! Another thing is the cut scenes are not even important to the game itself or the MyCareer mode! So why can't I skip it and just move on so I can play my game? And one more last thing: MyTeam.

As for gameplay in Mycareer, your start off with a god-awful player as usual, and they took away Rookie difficulty and made the AI play like it\u2019s the hardest difficulty even on Pro difficulty ( Which used to be one tier above Rookie). More incentive purchase their BS VC. Layups are completely broken, you will blow wide open layups and then watch the CPU make an and-one layup on the other end. You will throw 10 ft outlet passes out of bounds. The fouls are ridiculous in Mycareer as well, virtually every time you press the block button on a drive by the CPU a foul is called on either you or the player guarding it. The turnovers are awful, you still get phased into other players out of nowhere and lose the ball on their body parts. Keep in mind this is the same BS from 2k14-17.

I'm trying to save you money that you don't know you're being roped into spending! The use of micro transactions in the game seem hypocritical because the community knows that 2K doesn't need this money badly. The company of 2K threw this huge thing in New York City where they invited youtubers to come and stay for free in a seemingly expensive hotel and were given free Nintendo Switches and shoes. So it's hard the justify the need for micro transactions at every turn here. Here are some of the places where micro transactions are placed in crucial parts of the game. Mycareer is a mode where you control a player that you can make look and potentially play like you do. But you have to spend VC in order to even make your basic player do basic things anyone in the nba can do like make layups. You may be one of those people like me who thinks that you can just grind past those micro transactions and of course it is certainly possible but I recently so something that showed someone had done the math and it'll take you 200+ games to get to a max character! Ask yourself if you personally have that much time to spend on a game. Something else you may be thinking is \"So what I have to pay a few extra buck, I'm willing to do that.\" Well if you want to pay to upgrade your player to it's cap of 85 you'll have to pay $100+. And I can't forget to mention how they upped the price for multiple things that make your player unique like hair, tattoos, and clothing. Myteam the other most popular game mode and you'll start the game out with not very good cards. This makes sense, because obviously it wouldn't make sense for people to start the game with the best cards. But compared to last yeah and the year before they give significantly less MT (the currency for just this game mode). This is an incentive for people to buy VC and open packs, but unlike in mycareer where you are guaranteed a good player, here you only have a chance to get a good player.  I've seen many youtubers who use the money they make from making 2K videos putting that money back into the game which is their choice of course but it shows their viewers how much of a rip off these packs are. The last mode I'll talk about is Play Now Online where you pick one team and play with that team against other people online based off which \"league\" you are in. This mode is generally fun and I do quite enjoy it and what stops this game from being a 0 is the fact that 2K added all time teams and a whole bunch more historic teams which is much appreciated. And when I was playing the mode last year I didn't notice this but it's possible the micro transactions were in there, but this year I've noticed you can buy wins. How on earth is this even a thing. Before I forget to mention, a player earns more VC the higher the league they are in. So this means a person can just pay to earn more money??? It's hard to wrap my head around this idea which basically raises it's middle finger to people who grind their way into the higher leagues. Okay that's enough complaining on just the micro transactions (If you want to know more basically just read the other user reviews). Time to get into the game play for this year. There are people who complained that 2K 17's game play was garbage. To be honest I was one of those people. There were so many different things wrong with that game. Then NBA LIVE 18 came out and people said the same thing except that this game play was worse than 2K 17's. Ironically, NBA 2K 18's game play now feels similar to NBA LIVE 18's. The dribbling feels much more stiff than last year and now when I pass I feel like the ball almost never goes to the person it was supposed to go to. I've compared the issues with this years iteration of the game and last years and it seems that with every step forward that 2K took forward by fixing a game play flaw that the community complained about last year, they went and messed something else up that made things worse. I found myself not having a life because I could play the game for 10+ hours at a time but now after a game or two I need to take a break and do something different because the game play can be that unbearable sometimes. Don't even mention the story that is unbearable and awful to watch. Plus there's the fact that you can't skip it. The audacity to not allow people to skip a story that is garbage to compared to amazing games that have a game thats story is amazing but you can skip it bewilders me. Last but not least is the lag. Plain and simple it can makes the game unplayable. I know that my game lags not because of me 1, because other online games don't lag in nearly the same way and 2, because I hear the same complaints from lots of other people. I can't add any points to the score because is it better? No. Is it worse? Yeah. Maybe the 1 is an overreaction but at the same time I find myself arguing with myself saying \"How is it an overreaction?\""], ["shordje", "User", "1", "Everyone who plays this game is saying the exact same thing - \"it feels like it should be a free to play game\"."], ["Alviseb", "User", "1", "I've been supporting nba 2K game for the last 5-6 years, but with 2k18 they crossed the red line.

The level of control and detail on and off the court is astounding.

The level of strategic control is astounding at this point. You can spend longer tweaking your defense than actually playing the game! On the other hand, just automate everything and run the floor and the coach takes care of everything. Same with the Team/League management aspects, simply out of this world.

The new \"story\" for MyGM mode that was very hyped up only lasts one season. The gameplay itself is decent, when you aren't dribbling off of the opponent's feet every other possession. In addition to microtransactions, The amount of server issues this game has is unbelievable, so you can't even play the modes half of the time.

It's really sad that supposed critics have this game rated so high when the game modes the majority of people play are unplayable do to game issues or the fact that the $60 just buys you access to the game. You now have to play the game like it's a second or third job to be able to get him to a level where the game seems enjoyable because your myplayer sucks so much.

I have two characters in My Career, an 88 overall pure sharpshooter and a 62 overall slashing play maker. For some reason my sharpshooter MISSES wide open 3 point shots from the corner and that's just the beginning of it. I have a 99 rated open shot 3, a 97 rated contested shot 3, and a 99 moving shot 3, WHY AM I MISSING WIDE OPEN 3'S WITH THOSE RATINGS AND BADGES ON TOP OF THEM?! Why is it that garbage time players make open 3's and i don't?! And then there is the full white meters which is an automatic miss for some reason. The logic behind shooting this year is so stupid it's laughable. Early release = make, Late release = make, GOOD release = MISS. Why is there not an option to change the way you shoot to make it so it matters on your players rating for that shot type? It shouldn't be based on how you timed your release. Also the way they made the grind to upgrade your player and get your badges is bad too.  Some badges take way too long to get, like for my sharpshooter i don't even have bronze tireless scorer yet, why? Because i don't need to take shots when my player gets tired on the court. I guess having a 97 stamina for my sharpshooter means that it only takes 2 dribble moves for him to get tired. Contested shots which shouldn't go in do go in,open shots that should go in don't go in. The main reason for this i think are badges. For some reason there are badges like deep and mid-range deadeye that help you make contested shots easier. However there isn't a badge for shooting when you're open but there is one for shooting when someone contests your shot. That's like saying \"if you contest this players shot it will go in\" instead of saying \"don't leave this player open, or he will drill this shot.\" This game costs 59.99 for the regular edition, 100.00 for the Legend Edition and 150.00 for the Legend Edition Gold. Give yourself a few seconds to take in how much that gold edition costs. That's just buying the game ITSELF. It costs 190k VC to upgrade ONE of your My Career players to an 85 overalls. 190k VC is 50 DOLLARS to get that player to an 85 overall that will probably end up getting patched. The passing in this game is terrible, the defense is terrible, and the layups are terrible. Short passes are either turnovers or go out of bounds. On defense i'm playing great D and they make a insanely contested shot. And your missing wide open layups. Some layups hit the backboard some of them don't even touch the rim. Dribbling kind of sucks too. Do to many dribbles and you get tired, do a crossover and its a turnover. do a stepback which gives you separation between you and your defender. That's not the case here. All we can hope for is for NBA Live to step up their game and come out with a banger that will make people choose to play 2k or live instead of buying 2k every year. Or we can hope for Ronnie2k and Mike Wang to retire from 2k and never come back."], ["meatball13", "User", "0", "Without a doubt the worst game I have ever played.

The gameplay is pure garbage \u2014 constant missed layups with no one in the vicinity, the inordinate amount of fouls, the scripting of the cpu, the number of missed open shots, etc. 2k obviously does not care about these complaints that the community has aired out, thereby disrespecting their fanbase.

This game is the worst 2k game I\u2019ve ever bought and the sad part is it might be the best basketball video game I've played as far as gameplay is concerned. I bought the game on launch and quickly quit playing it after a week or two. I am a mycareer player only and after seeing all the glitches and microtransactions I decided the game wasn\u2019t worth playing or at least not in its current state. I finally decided to pick it up and start playing again Sunday night (January 28th) I had heard that 2k had fixed some of the microtransaction concerns and I know that at this point the game has been patched a few times so I figured I\u2019d give it a shot. Using the 25 dollar PSN 25 gift card that I had since Christmas I bought some VC (stupid I know) because I honestly wanted to see how far 25 bucks (90,000 VC) would get me if I used it all on a fresh 60 overall player. In the end I got to 75 overall and since then I've played 5 games on all-star difficulty and so far I have only made about 2500 VC which was enough to upgrade my player 1 attribute point in a major skill (layup) and enough to get 4 non-generic dribble animations that actually allow me to get open for shots. Even at 75 overall, I am still missing wide open shots going 2/10 and 3/10 in back to back games. I\u2019m not taking bad shots and I\u2019ve been practicing my shot on my court and in the team workouts where I am being guarded so I can adjust for that. I can get green shots at least half the time in those situations which tells me that my shot timing changes in the game and that isn\u2019t fair and it seems like another way that the game is pushing you to pay to make your shot better. I miss 2k14 so much not because it was the best 2k ever, but because in that game I could make my player better, get on court accessories, and get a bunch of different badges all without spending a dime after the original purchase. The gameplay and graphics weren't as nice as 2k18 but the game was much more fun because there wasn\u2019t a paywall and tons of microtransactions holding you back from enjoying the core game. I wish these publishers would stop being so dang greedy. I just wanted to pay my 60 dollars and play mycareer mode I want to upgrade my player without spending any more cash and maybe get a cool story to go along with it, but that will probably never happen again. I don\u2019t play park, or pro-am, or myleague, or myGM but still I am forced to pay money for VC just so I can have a decent player to play the games AI. I'm so sick of buying a game for 60 dollars just to be forced to pay more just so I can enjoy the core game right from the start. People will say you don\u2019t have to pay if you don\u2019t want to well it cost almost 190,000 VC to get to 85 compared to the 180,000 VC it took to fully upgrade a player to 95 last year and you can start to see the problem. This game basically forces you to pay to have a decent player if you have any kind of life away from your console and me for one will not be buying another 2k game until this paywall is removed. I am a diehard 2k fan I\u2019ve been playing since 2k9 and I just won\u2019t allow myself to be ripped off by these people anymore. I just wanted to play standard mycareer mode and upgrade my player at a decent pace based on how well I play against the AI is that too much to ask for?

Well, EA wanted to improve on 14, so they can beat the 2K franchise in basketball, which is a hard task, because 2k14 and 2k15 are excellent. Live 15 improves, but only 1.1% more.

The amount of crowds increases, and surprisingly, it holds more packed punch in the detail layer than the 2k series. But all that doesn't matter when the game isn't good. The handling is still awkward, and the ball (while looks improved) doesn't go through the hoop, even when you have an excellent release. The modes are a huge ripoff of 2K, like CAREER, MANAGER, etc. And EA also copy one mode from THEIR own game series, the Ultimate Team mode is added from FIFA to NBA! And it works like sh*t.

Even when you play well, you don't get rewarded, grinding for gear is tougher than ever (even tougher than that turd, Destiny!) and the Sprite Slam Dunk Contest is product placed with many companies to make extra profit. But we all know why EA ventures into all sports categories even when they suck at any, for the lies and the profit. But there is a cool feature, to jump into any game going on in any score and play from there. And 2K can borrow from only that part. But everything else, 2K, keep on doin whatcha gotta do, because EA has a long way to reach excellence."]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/82aa4143d5bc8c8d0b519d297f4fc1b2.jpg"}

The game mode that everything is centered around. You can rise through the ranks of the Summer pro am tour or the NBA to become the ONE! The thing I love about this game mode is it doesn't focus on all the negative aspects of your game. You get points for off ball moves like screens and boxing out. You can also double team and not get penalized for leaving your assigned player. You don't get sucked in on defense and defense is actually fun to play on any game mode! No longer do you need to fork out money to upgrade your player because win or lose you will get points to upgrade your player. The only place if you feel inclined to fork out more cash  in Live is My Team its just as good as madden. I have had no issues with online play with the EA servers. The only game mode that I see is lacking in NBA LIVE 18 is the Franchise mode. 2k Definitely has LIVE beat in this mode. The commentary on 2k is also way better. That's about the only places. The graphics are awesome there are a few minor bugs. (nothing that can't be fixed though updates.) Overall NBA LIVE 18 is a breath of fresh air compared to the roster updates we get every year from the 2k series. Don't take my word for it all you need to do is download both demos play them and judge for yourself!"], ["Gonzo8428", "User", "9", "Played the demo and knew thia would be a day one purchase.

Let's get all the bad out of the way first. First off, it needs a constant internet connection at all times to even play it. Yeah, it is an always online game! The weird thing is, it shouldn't even need one there is no reason for it at all. All past Need For Speed games didn't need a constant internet connection to play, so why does this one? My internet can be quite patchy, so i found myself unable to play the game at all while my internet connection was patchy. Also, because it needs a constant online connection, the game does stutter quite a bit in places. It spoils the game entirely. The handling is awful and takes a long time to get used to. I've played a lot of racing games over the years and get used to the handling pretty quickly. But not with this game, it takes a time. The game world feels empty and dull. As a result the game get's very boring very quickly. The cut scenes are just laughably cringeworthy and bad. They try so hard to be cool that they fail miserably. The A.I is poor. I've been about half a mile behind, only for the other racers to slow down until i catch them up. Once you catch them up, and you will catch them up stupidly quick, they all of a sudden want to race again. They have done this in an attempt to make the races exciting, but it just feels silly. All race games have a form of catch up on them, but this was is the worst because it is so blatently obvious. There is also no option for manual shift. Which is very odd given that this game has a lot of customization. The customization is one of the only good things about this game. There is quite a lot to customize like previous underground games.  Just a shame the rest of the game spoils it. The graphics are good in places. Sound is also quite good.

The selection of cars is quite big to so any kind of car fan should be able to find a car he or she likes. Each car also handles slightly different but with the upgrade system in the game you are able to tweak a car to your preferences. The process of choosing the car you wanted to build up, saving up the money and then upgrading was one of the most enjoyable parts of the game. Then once you start racing with said car the game really starts coming together. Seeing your creation in motion is awesome and usually inspires you to go buy another car and do it all over And you will need to in the game. It has multiple types of races from Circuit,Sprint,Drift,Drift Train and so much more, So it can be hard trying to build one car that can do it all. The Driving in NFS is defiantly something more related to a arcade racing game but is still enjoyable. Fans of more realistic driving games may find it hard at first to adjust. The streets you race on seem to always be wet or it's raining so drifting and sliding around cars and corners is easy and fun buy at times in the wrong car or turn things become difficult. Later in the game you can run into some extremely uneven races and challenges that may become frustrating and sadly trying to \"Restart\" A race just makes you reload to before the race start and then load the race all over again, This becomes Extremely frustrating after only a few times and is a major oversight. The story to the game isn't very interesting and is told thought live action cinematics like previous games and sadly almost every-time the actors are horrible and it's no different this time around.

You don't engage in long enjoyable chases, instead you get pulled over for doing 60 -70 mph. Again NFS most wanted does it perfect and this game does the exact opposite of that. Next the story. I hate to use this word because it's so overused, but good god the characters and dialogue is so god damn **** CRINGEY! You feel no attachment to the characters, there not interesting, and there acting is atrocious. It all feels very faked and forced. But more importantly the gameplay. NFS most wnated has great control and the turning is precise and intuitive. However in this bag of **** the turning is awful. You just need to play it for yourself. I can best describe by saying when you go to turn it takes 2 seconds for your car to start turning. For a game with so many tight turns that require great control this game just flat out ****s the bed. Not to mention the races become way too **** and difficult and you don't feel satisfaction when you beat them, instead you're still **** pissed off. The difficulty spikes  are ridiculous.

The graphics looked great and enjoyed the drift mechanics. That being said there was so much that made this game terrible for me. Starting off with the pop ups while driving causing u to crash while reading what they were trying to tell you to do. Why would this not pause the game so you could read it. Example if your out running away from the cops and you get a pop up saying u should out run the cops but crash and get busted because you can no longer see your screen thats ridiculous. It takes you like 20 mins to get from your garage to a race. Tho you can jump to your garage easily it is not that easy to get back to the missions. Heres an example of one of my races which frustrated me. I was winning the race  but because the track changes so much you must pay close attention to your mini map, I hit a wall returned to game after the crash and was instantly crashing again without any reason. 2 crashes in one crash not even sure why. So I had no chance to catch up to first player even tho I only made one mistake. I couldn't even find that same race to replay it. I just have to accept coming in second instead of being able to replay my last race or something. Also I have tried a lot of games with drag racing and this was by far the worst version I have ever tried. I try and shift up and it doesn't shift properly. I find myself either over shifting up too many gears or not shifting at all and staying in first. It was a really bad idea to use second joystick to shift. Also had to leave one of my games because someone trolling me just kept trying to crash into me constantly so I couldn't even get to my missions. I used to love the old need for speeds and was really hoping this would be closer to the old underground series which it was minus a few main important details the old games were very playable and this is not. I usually get annoyed by something within  the first 10 mins of playing and have to shut it off. I feel like there was a lot of potential. I hope the next one is more like the classics tho the customizing in this game was really good too.

There are some graphical errors in cutscenes and the likes, but it has just been released so that is to be expected. It has a blockbuster plot in a regular story. It has derelicts which work like forza's barn finds or the crew's hidden cars and are early throughout the story progression. It has a wild variety of cars, from muscle cars to suvs. Overall a great purchase.

The graphics are not a step up from Most Wanted 2012 despite it running on Frostbite 3 in 1080p. As a sequel to Hot Pursuit 2010, Rivals does a good job in giving the player more freedom by adding more content. You have more choice over how you progress in the career, and you can actually use your speed points to upgrade cars and buy pursuit tech. As a racer, you have an incentive to escape the cops. Unlike Hot Pursuit, this game is open world ,albeit nowhere in the same league as Burnout Paradise in terms of content. However, much of the magic that Hot Pursuit had has been lost. The driving attempts to be less arcade and drifty, and in doing so, it's lost the sense of speed so it's no longer intense. There seems to be no difference between a good and bad driver. You can crash and be as imprecise as you like and still get the gold medal in a time trial. The promise of customisation is poorly realized. Visually all you can do is change the colour and number plate, and performance-wise you can do some basic upgrades but no tuning. Furthermore, there are no tiers of cars. The performance difference is substantial in the menus, but on the road it's difficult to tell apart a Cayman S from a 458. There's just so little excitement in this game. I's just full throttle all the time with no need to be precise or skillful in any way. You can't be bad at this game.

I had my first truly, \"next-gen\" moment with this game. I'm maxing out my Mustang GT on the interstate, when I decide one of the many a.i. racers I've been passing needs to be put in his place. I start the head to head with a strong nitrous boost and jump out in front. As I am changing lanes and fighting for the lead, a patrolling Corvette tops the horizon and hits his red and blues. My pursuit tech is low on the 'stang, so I know I have to outrun and out maneuver my pursuers. As I blast off the interstate and hit a couple of sharp corners, I notice the road has changed to a frosted mountain pass. The sun is setting and my heat level is climbing fast. Now there must be 5 or 6 patrol cars in my rearview all fighting to stay on my tail as I do all I can to navigate the now, snow and ice covered pass. The snow is really coming down now, and my visibility is almost nothing as I'm drifting around corners with the red and blue snow practically filling my screen. The rush that this moment gave me is pretty rare in racing games today, and this doesn't even use the amazing multiplayer aspect that this game also brings with it. Imagine driving around with 150K speed points that you spent the last 20 minutes dodging roadblocks, spike strips, and EMP's to earn, when you crash big, and check your \"easydrive\" GPS to find out you are 2 miles to the nearest hideout. Then a human driver in a Lambo' enforcer T-bones you. Now you are in for the run of your life back to the safe house to bank those points.

The graphics are not a step up from Most Wanted 2012 despite it running on Frostbite 3 in 1080p. As a sequel to Hot Pursuit 2010, Rivals does a good job in giving the player more freedom by adding more content. You have more choice over how you progress in the career, and you can actually use your speed points to upgrade cars and buy pursuit tech. As a racer, you have an incentive to escape the cops. Unlike Hot Pursuit, this game is open world ,albeit nowhere in the same league as Burnout Paradise in terms of content. However, much of the magic that Hot Pursuit had has been lost. The driving attempts to be less arcade and drifty, and in doing so, it's lost the sense of speed so it's no longer intense. There seems to be no difference between a good and bad driver. You can crash and be as imprecise as you like and still get the gold medal in a time trial. The promise of customisation is poorly realized. Visually all you can do is change the colour and number plate, and performance-wise you can do some basic upgrades but no tuning. Furthermore, there are no tiers of cars. The performance difference is substantial in the menus, but on the road it's difficult to tell apart a Cayman S from a 458. There's just so little excitement in this game. I's just full throttle all the time with no need to be precise or skillful in any way. You can't be bad at this game. So in summary, the attempt to offer more of the same is a sensible idea, but overall Rivals lacks the excitement that Hot Pursuit delivered.

Racers focus more on team co-operation and speed while as cops focus on brute force and tactics the formula works and no longer will the cops and racers be using the exact same vehicles as in Hot Pursuit cause they all have their own unique vehicles.

Ok I want to start off positive because there is some good stuff. The graphics and the new arenas and commentating are outstanding. Unfortunately it ends there. I bought this game just for HUT and so I am biased upwards in my review since I am not really affected by the content that was not included from previous years. That said I expected HUT to be fixed....and it is the same ol garbage. How do you build a game from the ground up and then just cut and paste last years software again. How is that building from the ground up. What a lie. Here is the scoop, the HUT mode is still fixed to make players feel confused about their players (Tilt is players not playing according to their expected stats) so they change them up and buy more. What is this? Yes momentum and Tilt are built into this game from the ground up. Just played the typical HUT cheesers and yes they can still get away with spamming pokechecks and doing the fairy moves all day long. Want to score a goal you can be anywhere on the ice as long as you move your stick quickly left-right-shoot its a goal. Tilt by far is the worse feature again as it ruins the legit nature of trying to make a team based on stats....throw it out the window if tilt exists the stats mean zero which is the foundation of HUT. If you build a game on stats then add tilt you break every aspect of the game that was intended and thus a score of 2 is fair....ok, on top of that menus for players and adding contracts are not intuitive and a nightmare and tedious. I was also dashboarded in one of my six online games. By my tenth game lost connection to the EA servers. Strategy menus are also terrible to toggle mid game...they are so inaccessible while game play is on...and also you would think after a game it would save the strategies you did change during the last game but no...do it again, every game start....on top of this i could not call a time out when normally id be able to. Again there is added momentum in the dying moments of periods to punish you for dramatic effect only. Again if someone owns a Datsyk your defense will part and make room all by itself. My personal favorite is trying to play the game with the score display in your face. Goal mouth scrambles you have to play through the scoreboard because it doesn't ghost out very well. No wait I change my mind. My favorite is the game disconnects you and when you log back in you find out it was so that they could update you with your daily reward. LOL sweet. Ruin my current online season every day with a randomized disconnection loss. Another favorite of mine is how I already played people with better teams than at the end of last year so the 20000 people playing are pretty much all scammers thats all that is left HUT addicts no normal people to play. Ok so my call is this game looks awesome and the players physics do seem a lot better however the rest of the implemenation negates all these improvements. The game is a huge joke and is only good for an evening to confirm how broken it is. Every untidy feature from previous years has been included-from the ground up. I really enjoy that saying because they remove stuff and put it back and call it ground up. Its comical. Well, to conclude HUT Is still fun on occasion but it is garbage without question all because of tilt and that fake exageration derived from it. One bonus though is they did manage to hinder puck farming by giving reward packs out instead. At least they got one thing correct in time for launch.

There is no flow anymore, the players seem to be able to turn on a dime at any speed and switch direction in a weird unnatural motion. This was semi entertaining before when you could hit, but now it is just a stick waving jungle in mid ice! Often not even worth passing to the lead man anymore with risk of losing the puck.

I feel like allot of the control has been taken away as far as switching players and utilizing them instantaneously to do what I want them to do. I had a guy just score on me short handed while I had three players between him and my goalie and none of them could get the puck from him just cause he was pressing the protect the puck button?

The new Draft Champions mode introduces the fantasy draft with fast rounds of superstar picks. For the first time in EA SPORTS NHL history, the World Cup of Hockey game mode lets you take to the ice on a global stage and compete with your national hockey heroes. The next generation of Be a GM introduces Franchise Mode where you answer directly to the owner and take total control of the team and the business, from fan concessions to promotional nights to the arena and city you compete in. NHL 17 also brings gameplay control over every inch of the ice. The new Net Battle system lets you fight for that critical space in front of the crease on offense and defense. Authentic goaltenders both look and play the part with true-to-life stances and smarter Reactionary Save Intelligence that lets goalies read and react with an athletic save or get big with the body to block the puck. Improved hitting, passing, puck pick-ups and skating let you own every zone and dozens of new goal celebrations bring the crowd to their feet making your biggest moments memorable.

It's not your fault, it's EA Sports' fault for making the puck go elsewhere, whether it be to the player directly behind you, or basically anywhere else besides the player you were aiming directly at. About half of the passes do not go where they are intended to go. It is very frustrating. You work hard to get down the ice, and it should be an easy cross-crease one-timer goal, but the pass goes to the goalie as if you were trying to pass it to them for some reason and not the guy that is wide open and right next to you. So the passing is dreadful, but the shot accuracy is even worse. Yes, real NHL players cannot hit the same little corner every single time, but they also don't miss the net by five feet every single time. Besides the passing and shooting problems, a new aspect of the game is that your player will now lose the puck for absolutely no reason whatsoever. You're just skating down the ice, not even making a move or anything, and whoops, there goes the puck. To add on, the overall game does not react fast enough to any given controller input. When I press a button, I want it to happen that very instant. Your AI teammates are made to be drooling vegetables, but the opponent AI is perfect. Seriously, they are a mirror to your every move, at least on the superstar setting. Congratulations, the game is finally more difficult but in all the worst ways possible. This is not a fun game to play if you like having total control over the games you play. You might as well just watch the computer play itself. It's as if EA Sports programmed the game to be this way, because top game developers would not let any of this happen on accident. They made a bad game on purpose. This is a franchise game, it's not like they're starting from scratch.They do not care at all. They put zero effort into making a decent game, and then they profit. This company cannot be taken seriously. EA Sports needs competition, especially for hockey. You should only buy this game if you want to waste money supporting a deplorable corporation that knows most people are dumb enough to pay whatever for total crap just because it's the latest version.

There is no skill, no glitch goals, and no sense involved in this game. At times you will hit every shot you intend and at other times the same shot will go wildly off the glass. I have played NHL almost exclusively for years and this is the first time I have considered dropping the series entirely. It is not luck, nor skill, nor strategy, the game is simply determined by which player is allowed to get ridiculous goals as the other player's entire team is doing exactly the opposite of what would be expected. Examples: Defensemen randomly skating towards the boards/blue line when there is a potential breakaway, a breakout begins and all offensive players skate backwards, wide open players missing wide open passes for no apparent reason, straight up inability to take slapshots when nobody is in the area, nightmarish passing decisions, and the list goes on. Don't quote me, but in NBA 98ish the user could choose which defensive player they would like to control ... Here we are in NHL 2017 and you can switch players until your fingers bleed and never control the logical choice. Let me choose who I would like to defend with, let me choose which player I am intending a pass towards, and if not, make the AI somewhat reasonable. There is a gap between users and developers/programmers that is growing. The online vs game is becoming undesirable, to me at least, because it feels like I have no impact on the game and/or that the game is blatantly separate from any realistic hockey that would ever be played. Also, if I am trying to hit a guy and happen to take the puck during the hit, then why is the realistic outcome to fire the puck in the direction in which the hit is intended?"], ["PlaystationRyan", "User", "0", "Stop buying EA NHL games.

AI pulls of moves like you never could, it will defend against you with 2-3 players and most of the time keep scoring basically impossible, and then depending on your predefined luck a chance of 1-6 times a game to score on easy one-timer or so. The most-of-the-time amazing defense would be fine if you could get your own AI to doing something useful on defence, but instead you basically always end up on 1v1 situation instead of 2-3v1 that the AI does... And you also pretty much always lose all board-plays as the AI executes like the machine it is... Also really fun feature is that the AI also sticks like a glue on you when they shadow. And when they come for a tackle it is like a train, which you can't avoid, even if you quite often get to a situation that you really can't tackle.

Negative: It can be realistic now, but because of that, it's also the most borring nhl that ever came out. Positive: They achieved to make lower final scores of the match. Negative: Because of that, now you get like 3 good chances for entire game and that's not enough fun to keep anyone playing. Positive: Every nhl 17 beta whiner who didn't like poke checking in beta can now fully enjoy poke checking at least 3 times to finally intercept player push while that player is maybe 1 meter far from you, he doesn't anyhow protect the puck and you can see how you did all those three times hit the puck but he's still under control of the puck without any collisions with the stick/puck.

I upgraded my HUT players early this year but it seems to make no difference - and this is a HUGE problem when players work and spend money to upgrade and find out it was time / money wasted.  Players with high ratings just aren't differentiated from players with lower ratings - doesn't matter if you are controlling the player or the AI is.  One timers have basically been eliminated, passing is delayed and makes the game frustrating and most players score using soft moves and passes into the goal (that score way too often) rather than actually shooting.

They should have returned to NHL 16 sets for team completions which reward \"canot trade\" packs instead of those **** sets with those **** 100k collectibles. Sets in this game are meaningless because they are never worth it. It's allways better to check auction house. Players wanted Winter Classic mode. No change in that. Players wanted reasons to play EASHL like implemention of stick, glove, skates or maybe even helmet stats. No change in that. Players were short cut again by WCH, playoff mode in exchange for NHL 3s mode which nobody asked for. EASHL should immediately erase 3s mode and they should release it each year after playoffs because since that time, EASHL players start to not care about this game. But dragging players away to way less fun 3s instead of 5s immediately in September is a horrible move. Players asked for 5-man celebrations. No change in that. They are so sassy that they announced that they are working on NHL 19 already without even trying to fix their current game. It can be also seen how they made 3 posts on their official site in almost 2 months and they even no longer communicate with players on facebook and they just ignore all their issues. That's proof good enough for me to know they no longer support a game which is not even 2 months old. We hear these days all the bad things about Andromeda face animation issues, about closing Visceral studio and people say the whole problem is that EA wants frostbite even there where it's not supposed to be like RPGs and sport games just because they'll sell better, it doesn't bother simple and dumb people that It's an engine complicated more than any other with which will come hundreds of new bugs and slower fix updates in exchange for good looking sport game. And  a surprise, EA Canada is working on NHL frostbite since September, tadaa. I want to see how next year NHL ends up but after what happened to Visceral studio I'm really concerned about this. Visceral studio was closed because the SW game which was probably going to have more similiar gameplay to Mass Effect than Battlefield, couldn't be pushed forward on frostbite engine.

I so badly want to love this game, but I feel as though the developers are focusing too much on the fluff and fillers than on the actual game itself.  For example:  there are little nuances in the game of hockey that make it, well you know... hockey.  Such as:  If you are overly aggressive in the face-off circle, in real life, the official would toss you out, but not here.  Pucks do not go into the stands nearly enough in this game.  You can jab away at a goalie freezing a puck, with little to no response from his teammates.  This physics engine needs to go.  The puck physics are pretty solid, but the physics that govern how the players interact with each other is really starting to get stale.  We still have no real excitement surrounding the on ice players when you score a goal.  Meaning, still NO 5 MAN GOAL CELEBRATIONS!!!  I cannot figure out how the FIFA developers can pull off goal celebrations like they do, but it seems to be of no importance to the NHL developers.  Seems crazy, considering that this is supposed to be a true hockey simulation, but we still are left with the awkward 2 man canned animations after a goal is scored, while the other on ice teammates skate away like the puck just got shot out of play.  So weird that this continues to be ignored by the dev team.  Like most sports games, the atmosphere is the key to creating that illusion of realism.  But since there hasn't been much emphasis placed on the subtleties of the sport, that realism factor really suffers.  Sure, the new 3's mode is fun, but I really feel like that is something that could have been added down the road or even as a DLC option, so that more time could have been spent on improving the overall simulation package.  Don't get me wrong.  NHL '18 does have better gameplay than NHL '17.  However, so far, 18 feels more like NHL 17.2.  I am starting to feel as though the NHL dev team might benefit more from doing what the NBA LIVE team just did, and take a season off.  The annual installments are beginning to feel more like $60 patches than completely new versions.  Unfortunately, without a competitor title being produced, this will most likely never change.

You are playing as an Android named 2B and your defense, and attack protocols are dependent on the \"chips\" (as in computer chips, or programs) you have and equip.

I wanted Hard difficulty without the possibility of getting 1 shot. I found Normal far too easy.

So I decide to jump down a hole towards a save point. I jumped down this hole dozens of times before to get to this save point. But because of the fetch quest I was doing at the time, something different happened. It triggered one of the game's joke endings with the hilarious punchline of kicking me back to two hours worth of progress. Nier Automata does not respect you or your time. It makes jokes about how much it wastes your time and about how boring the tasks you have to do are, at the same time forcing you to do the same tedious tasks it makes fun of. The story it offers is really solid, but the monotonous garbage you have to go through in between each story beat is insulting. Every quest is a boring fetch quest. Warp to location, run to the objective marker, run back, warp to the quest giver, rinse repeat. The dialogue is always either funny, dark, provoking, or some combination of those and is genuinely great content. It's so much running back and forth with the characters also complaining about how boring the task they've been given is. For a pro tip, this doesn't make your game clever, it makes it pretentious and annoying. Aside from running what you also do is some of the dullest combat in an action game I've played. In terms of complexity, the combat is a tick lower than God of War with 9S being one of the most boring experiences I've had in a AAA game right up there with Bioshock Infinite. There is zero combo potential and only about 4 weapon types that all don't actually change how you approach enemies. Pod customization doesn't really add much either, the only Pod plug in that makes combat more interesting is the zip line type utility. With such a lack of depth, the combat loses its charm extremely quick. You don't learn any new moves, your initial moveset is extremely limited, but the most insulting part is that you don't get better at the combat. There's nothing new to learn. The only \"advanced\" technique I've been able to find and see people discuss is self destruct cancelling. Which all it does it let you do your standard Square combo faster. A massive disappointment from the company that made the Wonderful 101. And then there's all these smaller, more obnoxious moments like when you have the option to tell an NPC how horrible and useless the map is. The NPC then gives you a smug response saying that you should go explore instead and not rely on the map. Listen, I'm running through this map back and forth for hours accomplishing your side quests. Sometimes, I would like to have some clarity on my objective so that I can run through the same area I've been through 30 times a little bit faster. And when your map is actually useless in areas like the Factory and Forest, it's **** boring to run around the area and guess where the quest marker is. I already explored these areas the first time through. I just want to go through the boring side quest to get the actually decent content. Exploring the same area 50 times for each side quest is not a fun experience and it's not something that you should make fun of you player for complaining about. And I think that small, meaningless interaction summarizes Automata. It expects you to put up with tons of garbage to get to anything meaningful or quality, which is such a shame because the story is great. Although even the story doesn't hold much respect for the player, or at least it feels like it was written by 5 different people. Which is strange considering how focused Taro's other visions are. 2B and 9S' opinion on things is so radically different for each quest it may as well be different characters doing each one. Like when you're in the valley where robots committed suicide, 9S informs me \"Don't trust them, they're only machines\". This is after hours and hours of content where the characters assume the machines are life, with 9S telling 2B to be nicer to machines of all things in a ton of these. Another thing, at the beginning of Route B, 9S looks on a machine that considers another machine his brother and 9S responds \"You can't make him your brother.\" But in a later side quest, 9S is confused by what a family unit is when talking about the old world. These are only the inconsistencies I can roll off my head after finishing, but playing I recognized a lot more and i couldn't take 2B or 9S seriously until the ending of Routes A and B where they finally became somewhat consistent."], ["reb0014", "User", "4", "This game could have been so amazing but a few things held it back.

Within the first couple of hours you'll find platforming, dialogue-driven gameplay, dungeon crawling, rhythm gameplay and puzzle solving all placed naturally and with finesse.

If at all possible it is highly recommended to download and play the two supplementary games on itch.io called \"Lost Constellation\" and \"Longest Night\".

This game has very charming characters, amazing music, and heavy themes. The only thing this game lacks is convential gameplay.

Sometimes it feels more like a visual novel rather than a game, which is okay for me because every other facet in the game makes up for it. I wish the game was much longer and allowed you to do the missions for all the characters in one playthrough, but it's not really a con in my book. The best part about this game is the interactions and relationships between the Mae, the player's character, and her friends. The dialouge is feels real and not forced, and the struggles that the characters go through are relatable and realistic. In the review from youtuber Shammy, he eloquently said that the things the characters go through recieve empathy from teens and sympathy from adults. Not everyone will be able to relate to the characters or the events, but those who do will recieve a much deeper experience. The way the game handled very heavy topics like depression, death, and derealization made me think the writers went through the things that the in game characters went through. As a 19 year old I instantly felt connected to each one of the characters in some way, and it made the events in the game have a much larger impact. After I finished the game I felt a big pit well up in my chest because I just wanted the story to continue, but the way the game wrapped up was satisfying. The unfortunate thing is that you only have so many days to hang out with one of your friends, Gregg or Bea(the main ones, there are more), so you end up only being able to complete one of their personal storylines. In my first [and only playthrough so far ;) ] playthrough I decided to hang out with Bea, the alligator girl. I won't spoil but her story in the game made me want to cry manly tears. I can't imagine doing Gregg's storyline right now because I will feel so guilty not being there for Bea, which is a weird feeling considering she's just a cartoon alligator. It's so crazy that the writers elicited these emotions. I believe it's because many games barely reach half these levels of character development, which makes this game stand out even more. I really don't know how to sum up my thoughts about this game, other than that you need to play it as soon as possible, because this is a very genuine game that deserves your attention."]], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "Switch", "Xbox One"], "image_url": "http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/d4b4b8dea97e1b18b9147c49cfbf5a37.jpg"}

Ki pulsing seems to be difficult to master for some people, but it really isn't. There are even skills to make the combat feel fresh for a while longer. The loot system makes it so that you're constantly changing your weapons and armor. I can see people not like this, but thankfully they added the ability to refashion your equips into anything you want but also keep the stats of what you're actually wearing. To level up you get Amrita from enemies then bank it into shrines that are scattered around in every mission. Co op is actually more enjoyable than I thought it would be. It makes the game a tad bit easier, but it was fun helping people pass through levels and then towards the end they do friendly gestures to you. Speaking of difficulty, this game is pretty hard. I constantly worried whether I should bank all the amrita I had, in case I died. Enemies have different moves, so they stay unpredictable for a while and they do quite a bit of damage. If you make a wrong move, you get punished hard. But the game is not impossible. It will feel as though this game might not be for you cause of its difficulty. But you can get better to the point where it sometimes becomes a breeze. Then you do the Twilight missions and you begin to question again if you're really good at this game at all. The overall look of the game is nice. The different locations really made it fun exploring the maps. The lighting is the only problem with the maps though. It makes it very hard to see whether the water is just a puddle or deep enough to kill you. If you're not into feudal Japan then it might look rather uninteresting.

I would say to them that is they can't see the comparison then they have never really played a Dark Souls game.  It is that obvious.  I can tell you 100% that there is MUCH taken from Dark Souls in terms of gameplay and mechanics.  Imo this is a good thing.  Nioh shines best at it's differences though.  I don't want to say what they are because it's better if you notice them yourself.  It's definitely a hard game, but how hard it is is up to you.  You can make it harder if you wan't to find all the secret areas and their bosses, and once you clear a particular area you can go back through it again with higher level enemies.  High risk but great reward.  The higher level enemies drop better loot.  One of my gripes (and honestly it has more to do with me not understanding how it really works) is the Ki.  Dark Souls fans would relate this to stamina.  If you don't manage your ki right, you can run out pretty quick and when that happens your character WONT move at all.  There is a way to replace used Ki if you time the trigger just right when you start to see a light around your character.  It totally reminds me of Bloodborne's health regeneration.  In BB if you attack after being hit you can replace some of that lost health.  Not EXACTLY like Nioh but pretty close.   What I didn't like much at all was some of the setting.  Towns and buildings, etc look really bland and uninteresting.

On both systems you can choose between better graphics, better frame rates, or a combination of both. My recommendation is to use the Action Mode for better frames rates and performance.

The sound quality of the game is great as I have no complaints about any of the music, voice acting, weapon sounds, ambiance, and enemy sounds.

Many people say that it's exactly like Souls, but I don't see it. The inspiration is there, but what has been created is one of the most original games I've played this console generation. The art style doesn't look as good as other games nowadays, or even the Souls games, but it works well with the game. The level design isn't as good as it is in the Souls games, but it's till better than most other recent games. The soundtrack isn't anything to call amazing, but it still fits. The weapon variety is weak, with only 5 different types of weapons, but at least each of them are unique and have completely different functions from the others. So what makes this game a 9/10? Well, first off, its combat. Nioh has one of the best combat systems I've ever seen in a video game. Its combat is based on stance, and given that For Honor, which has similar combat, was released a mere week after it, it didn't really get the recognition it truly deserved. You have high, low, and mid stances, and all weapons you use force you to change your stance in order to get the most effective use out of it. Some enemies, including bosses, require you to change your stance, no matter what weapon you're using. Nioh doesn't exactly shine in its enemy variety, as a lot of the levels feature the same basic smokey skeletons or samurai as most of the foes you face. They all have great design that goes hand-in-hand with the setting, but it gets tiring seeing the same people some times. The bosses, however, define the game's challenge and creativity. Each boss is different from the last, and I never felt like I fought the same guy (or girl) twice. They all have different attack patterns, some easier to memorise than others, which make them all feel unique. Now some may ask: how the customisation? Well, compared to the Soulsborne games, character customisation is literally nonexistent. You can't alter your character's appearance at all, but considering that this game focuses more on straightforward story rather than lore, I could see why. But if you prefer clothing customisation, you're in for a treat. There are so many different types of armour, and each of them have different looks and styles than the others. If you don't like the look of one, but want to keep the stats, you can take it to the Blacksmith, and have her refashion it to look like a different piece of armour that you've discovered. You can do this with weapons, too, and it's something I've always dreamed of seeing in a video game. Overall, Nioh has it's flaws, but they are very quickly overshadowed by it's achievements. The fluid combat and movement systems combined make some incredible, fast-paced gameplay, the enemy designs, while repetitive at times, still stands out thanks to the unique bosses, and it's customisation for weapons and armour separates itself from most other games on the market. But there's still one question: is it hard? I'm glad to say, yes. It's brutal, but that's why we love it. 9/10."], ["v_iHuGi", "User", "10", "Been playing this gem lately and holly sh**, what a magnificent game Team Ninja has crafted here, the gameplay is sublime and level design is also pretty damn good although levels might be a little short for SoulsBorne veterans. it is still very competent mind you, the game itself is fast and fluid without fps problems unlike From Software efforts where framepacing is pretty damn terrible, here it is silky smooth which helps this game alot since it is really fast paced, it reminds me of Onimusha with a Soulsborne vibe to it, it is a excellent game and you should buy it ASAP."], ["MacheteDontText", "User", "8", "+ :  Excellent combat, engaging, skill intensive, hard, but fair, huge variety of weapons, styles and tools.

First couple of planets were somehow different, but then I started to discover planets, which were just re-skinned versions of basic planet archetypes. Toxic planets, radioactive planets, ice planets? Only difference is logo above the shield and exosuit alert message. Behavior is all same - it just reduces protection level continuously. Every animal and every flower is almost same and acts the same. On planet 1, you get cow body with dog head, on planet 2 you get cow body with chicken head. On planet XY you get cow body with head XY etc. What is the point of discovery, when everything you can discover is just some randomly generated stuff with no logic in it? What is the meaning of discovering caves, when there is no secret at the bottom? From technical point of view, game is really good. I really enjoyed views on some planets.

Exploration is about finding new things, and while each planet is technically unique many of them feel extremely similar. Each planet is of a single biome. While Hello Games told us this would be the case, it doesn't excuse the fact that it makes planetary exploration fairly dull. While there are certain outposts placed on many planets for you to find (once you've seen one outpost, you've seen all of them). A level of diversity on the planets, mountains, rivers, deserts, etc. accompanied with varied wildlife for each of these biomes would give more reason to explore a larger amount of the planet.

I am now done with this game. I will be taking it back to GameStop so I can get some money back as it became overwhelmingly redundant after hour 10-15. The planets might have different fauna and textures but the actual terrain is exactly the same from planet to planet. There are only few different materials really to collect, as plutonium gives you everything to survive, move, and mine. Titanium, Iron and Zinc help with creating tech. And other than that you have a revolving door of \"precious metals\" to collect for no other reason than to make money, and are found and mined the same way. I'm frustrated as Sean Murray alluded that you can create things like minecraft, but in reality you have to find blue-prints and cannot use imagination to create things. Then again, there aren't enough different elements to make that challenge worth while. The caves are all built the same way. There are no rivers or anything that would break up a very patch-work environment. Everything in Space (planets, space stations, ships) is static except the pirates that seem to come after you much like spam ads hit you on the internet. The ships aren't even attackable or trade-able, they are their for background. For story, its very shallow text based experience. Understanding races languages does very little to change anything other than improving very boring dialog during trading stations that gives marginal benefits. I don't want to tell you too much about the end-game, but the game has a redundancy that extends beyond jumping system to system, but galaxy to galaxy that will make you want to pull your hair out. There is no sense that others are in the same galaxy. You are completely alone, as Sean Murray explained THE DAY BEFORE RELEASE. I personally do not believe we share the same universe, but share a multi-dimension universe where we are just uploading names of places. The game was an absolute joy for the first 10 hours..... but then, I started wondering what the damn point was. I did buy the game for a lot of reasons that Sean was talking about during the IGN first and videos prior. I did not realize that a lot of the ideas he was floating earlier would not make it into the final product as they just plainly ran out of time. Its a shame, because the game has an idea, and for a team of 14 people, pretty amazing..... but if it is not what was explained to people, it should not be a $60 AAA game. Some blame the gamer for the misunderstanding of the game. I don't, I blame the marketing of Sony and the numerous streams of Sean Murray for not being honest about the final build of the game.

The controls are clunky, the sound effects obnoxious, the music a huge disappointment.  I found that the totality of the aesthetic experience, something I thought would really be a selling point in this game, is utterly lackluster.  It's amazing just how often the sound effects and music combine to create a supremely unpleasant effect.

I had my reservations that these guys were in way over their heads, and sadly, my fears are confirmed.  There's a reason AAA titles are developed by huge teams: that's what it takes.

At it's heart No Man's Sky is a survival game, that's really it. I've played for several hours, bought a new ship and done basically the same thing over and over again. I think the biggest issue with the game is the fact that it is so open ended. The game lacks substance. They're only a few goals to complete that I've gotten to so far. You really don't feel that sense of accomplishment you do in other games. Your mining tool overheats too quickly and at times it's monotonous and feels like babysitting when you have to collect materials to power your various technological assets. The biggest problem with the game is it spreads itself too thin. There aren't really ant familiar or iconic landmarks to latch onto (due to random generation everything just feels lifeless and dull). Often times I'll just jump hopelessly from planet to planet and mine gold. Then I use the gold to purchase items/tech/upgrades I need. There aren't many difficult enemies to fight (maybe there are but I haven't seen them yet). There's no challenge, just hopping from one place to the next hoping to find excitement and adventure. Due to the openhandedness of the game I feel lost, nothing grabs me and encourages me to dig deeper into the world. Which is because I know I'll never see all there is too see. No one can. There's no focus, no quests (objectives but no real characters or missions or story), not even multiplayer. This game would be more fun if you could play with friends and adventure to new worlds with them. I originally thought everyone around me was a player in a ship flying by. Nope. Those are NPCS.

My first planet was this icy planet with low temperatures that killed me very quickly.

I spent ages trying to discover every plant and animal on my planet, and was excited to finally leave in search of exciting planets. However, that feeling of excitement quickly wore off for me. After a while you realise the games limitations in what is supposed to be an infinite universe. Planets would start to look the same, space stations lacked any variety, and interaction with npc's became very limited. On a side note, how am I the first person to discover a planet if there are already alien life forms scattered around said planet? Putting aside the lack of gameplay features that people were told would be in the game, No Man's Sky feels extremely bare bones. What is the point of having 18 quintillion planets in a game? Why create a game where 99% of it will never be discovered? The only reason I carried on playing this game was the hope of finding something new an exciting in the universe. Needless to say, I didn't. Maybe this game will improve with regular updates and added gameplay features.

You cannot fly into the sun so all the talk about real physics of planet rotation etc was wrong.   For the development team I think they could fix the game and make it enjoyable by 1. Making resources hard to get/less abundant and survival more difficult  2.  Making flight mechanics real with total player control in flight and in landing and 3.

I don't know why he thought he could return the game at gamestop lol.  I was only able to play the game AFTER hearing all the complaints.  I was lucky.  I got to go into it knowing it wasn't the revolutionary game most of us thought it would be before launch.  But I digress.  The truth of the matter is that it is a beautiful game to explore planets, space stations, and wild life.  The problem I have with that is after a couple hours with the game there just wasn't much to see.  Everything looks like everything else, just with minor differences.  Besides collecting materials to upgrade your ship, suit and mining gun there just isn't much to do.  It might be different if each item required a different process to upgrade but it doesn't.  For everything you own you MUST upgrade or fix it by pointing your \"mining laser\" at a certain element and holding the trigger down.  Its an endless loop, and unfortunately for me the endless loop is not even slightly entertaining after the first couple hours.  What was I expecting though?  After all, Hello Games is an indie developer with very limited money, and man power.  To be honest I feel quite stupid.  I believed Sean Murray.  I believed in what he was trying to sell.  After not hearing ANYTHING since a couple days after release I know now Sean is just another \"used car salesman\" trying to make a living by scamming hard working people who are passionate about video games.  I don't know why I actually thought he was one of us.  A person who doesn't look at video games as a silly toy for children but an art form.  A canvas of artistic expression.  I give this game a 5 out of 10 because the first few hours gave me a feeling I don't have the words for.  The problem is, that feeling was far from everlasting.

The day before No Man's Sky came out, I realized that the game would never be able to live up to the hype that it created. How did this revelation come about? Well, that was the day Sean Murray, the game's lead developer,  tweeted that the game wouldn't feature multiplayer. This is a problem because in previous interviews, Sean promised that you would be able to play with your friends. Trust me, this isn't the only thing Sean lied about, but there's way more videos and articles out there that go way more in-depth about this topic, so go find those if you want to learn more. Anyways, I was perfectly fine if the game didn't live up to all of the hype, as long as it was still a great game. Well, let me say it's not. It's not a good game, not even an okay one. It's just mediocre. For those who don't know what this game is, it's one of the most ambitious games ever made. The game is meant to give you a glimpse of the size of the universe. So then how big is it? Try 18 quintillion planets to explore big. It delivers on this promise because the open world is huge, so it's safe to say that this is officially the largest game ever created. But as we've seen with past open world games, a larger world could mean that there's less to do. This is definitely a complaint for this game. It's a survival game, but unlike another survival game like Minecraft, you're very limited in what you're able to do. After a strong introduction where you repair your crashed ship, you then have to build a warp drive so you can travel to different galaxies. This is still cool. But after your first time travelling to a different galaxy, the game drops in entertainment value sooooooooooooooo much. From this point on, all you are doing is collecting resources to fuel your warp drive so you can reach the center of the universe. Not only does this get tedious as quickly as the second time you do it, it also progressively gets more frustrating to complete this task. Maybe it's just from personal experience, but almost none of the planets I found had the resources I needed. This meant I had to jump from planet to planet before I finally found what I required. On top of that, you have to deal with the smallest inventory in the world, even with the addition of being able to move items to your ship. When you run out of space, you'll have to find an outpost that may or may not have a store, or go all the way back to the ONE SINGULAR SPACE STATION IN AN ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEM! It's flat-out annoying, and borderline intolerable. Going back to planets, I'm gonna close off with the game's biggest issue: planetary design. Sean Murray promised that almost every planet was going to be unique, with some desert planets having dunes and little vegetation, or a tropical planet being mostly water and having underwater outposts and bases. None of this is in the game. After my first planet, every single one after that felt barren and empty. I know it sounds like a lot of work trying to make all 18 quintillion planets different, but if they knew they weren't going to be able to deliver that, they shouldn't have promised it. In the end, it comes down to the fact  that Hello Games promised way more than they could give with No Man's Sky, and rather gave us a mediocre game that is nowhere near to earning it's $60 asking price. 5/10."], ["megawavez", "User", "6", "This game is really a mess.

The alien interactions are pointless, there are three species, none give you anything interesting or tell you anything new, you learn a word occasionally, but even when you learn most of the words the conversation is mind numbing, they basically just ask you for some carbon to power up a battery or something along those lines, no lore to discover or stories to tell. Overall this game has the most tedious, boring \"loop\" gameplay, you mine minerals to fuel your ship, you sell minerals to buy a new ship and you craft ship/gun components out of minerals... thats it folks, you can of course go to a new star system and do that all over again if you wish, and again, and again, and again. This is not a survival game, this is not a space sim, this is more akin to Journey and other boring indie/art games that have you do nothing but walk/fly around and look at basic scenery with pixelated textures but hide it with bright colours. Wait for Mass Effect 4 or play the other two games mentioned above."], ["BriMach", "User", "4", "Over-hyped, tedious, boring.

When I went to work the first day after playing No Man's Sky I gave it a resounding 8/10. I'll admit I was one of those who bought into the hype but I severely scaled back my expectations right before the game came out after the reports from Dameon who bought the game early for 1300 bucks. Despite a hefty day one update he was still mostly dead on accurate. But after experiencing semi frequent crashes (Btw of the 3 friends I have who play this all of their games have crashed numerous times. One of them can't even get in the game the last two times so he stopped trying until a patch is finished.), lazy building/resourse modeling, unengaging gameplay that requires you to be sitting pointed at rocks and other resources (which all look  exactly the same) for hours on end, and endless weak instances of getting attacked by the same two enemy types (Pirates and sentinals) for the entire game. I have now landed at a 4. For a game that seemed to have endless imagination, Hello Games managed to put almost no imagination into a story or purpose behind all of this monotonous crap. I've logged probably about 40 hours into this game btw. I held on hoping that as the story unfolded and my gear was upgraded I'd be treated to a more pleasurable gaming experience, but the enjoyment never game. I found myself sick of landing on the same types of planets over and over again, disappointed with the thrown together piles of body parts they called creatures, and annoyed with the constant need to find resources to continue on my journey. I set my sights on one thing in the end, reaching the center of the galaxy. Boom I started blasting off flying from planet cluster to planet cluster hoping for an epic finish to what has been a lackluster journey. After 40 hours of total gameplay I seem to be no where near a finish to this game which sucks cause its hard to want to finish. Why 15 Quintilian?? If your going to just lie or being incredibly vague about the multiplayer aspect of the game, at least give people the satisfaction of saying, \"Oh hey someone named this planet already. Wow that's hilarious. Great Job Hello Games!!\" But pretty much no ones said that. Cause when this shotty games connection to the network is actually active you don't see dick from other people. Not a planet, definitely not a creature, and not even a system. This game is so big to the point where it removes the \"moments\" Sean Murray blabbed about for months leading up to the game. After 40 hours I'd expect to see at least a planet named by someone....but every planet I've found so far I've discovered. Seems to kinda defeat the purpose don't you think? But I could forgive all the multiplayer bs, the lazy modeling, and the complete lack of a compelling story if the game was just fun, but to say it is would be an outright lie. Sloppy controls to the combat make it hard to enjoy which leaves mining resources and looking at procedurally generated planets as the only real enjoyment factor to this game. The only reason its not lower than a 4 is occasionally I would land on a planet and look out over a field of blue grass and be like \"Yup this is the only thing that makes this journey worth it\". But without more even that seems to fall flat on its face. So I leave you with this question folks. If you were to buy a brand new Tesla automobile with the latest technology in electric vehicles and it ran like absolute crap, would you consider it a good car just because the technology was so advanced? No. You wouldn't. Because people don't buy cars just to look at them. They buy for the ride. No Man's Sky has deprived me of the thrill of the ride while charging me for a cutting edge sports car.

This is not a game for hardcore completionists or those looking for a compelling story. Go ahead and try crushing this game, it is literally trying to take on the universe.  My back ground is in Computer Science and Philosophy and I'm also an avid student of science so I am sympathetic to this game and I can easily get lost in it.  I really appreciate the technology here as what Hello Games has done will have a profound impact on the future of video gaming forever. Hello Games have delegated some of the responsibility of game design to algorithms. Not an original concept, but damn, it's the size of a universe. As some one familiar with computer programs, I'm amazed this game even works, let alone provide a gaming experience of any kind. I do agree this game was over hyped, and is not quite what anyone thought it would be; but for the love of Zeus, it's only a team of 13 people! So far, many believe this game lacks depth and is way too tedious. I can certainly see that and this game is not for everyone or even the majority of people. I feel that if you have a scientific mind, then you will appreciate this game(but that is not a requirement for enjoyment). The wonder of discovery, the awe-inspiring moments, and the challenge to try to come to grips with the enormity of the universe is why I love No Man's Sky. It accomplishes what good Science Fiction does, inspire future discoveries and innovation. It is overpriced for what it offers considering what the majority of people want from a video game, but it is worth it for me. A game with a deep story, great combat, graphics conducive to immersion, and choices that truly matter is something I and many other gamers adore and crave. This game doesn't nail all of that and I understand the feeling of hollowness people feel about this game. They want more. That is a feeling I can respect. Play his game casually, in the dark, with some good quality headphones (if you can) and you may appreciate it more. I also love sharing what I find with my friends, but I suppose good friends can make anything fun. However, it provides the feeling of being a explorer, which is one of the beautiful parts of being a human and a trait that was once celebrated in America. This game is a bit ahead of the curve in some areas but does fall short in others. I am excited to see what else they add to the game and what other games are going to be like that are inspired by this one. No Man's Sky will contribute a lot to the video game industry and the scientific community as a whole. It is not only a game, it is a computer generated experiment and the users are the observers.

I think I blew it up mining a massive resource pile, and exceeded the systems ability to manage the environmental change. Stopped short of strip mining the final time. [2] DATA LOSS - On the 4th day there was a late night crash. So I went to bed, started up the next day and had lost all progress. Normally this would be devastating. I had moved too fast, poorly handled the opening game play and was considering restarting that day, so I took it in stride. Ready to restart. That said, I DO NOT want to do it again. So I need to find a way to make sure I have a backup of my save. [3] TUTORIAL - The tutorial agenda isn't well balanced and handles disruption poorly.  Second time around I knew I needed to build Warp Cores, and planned for it, building some items early. After getting the an early recipe for a component. I was forced to rebuild the pieces I already had to get them checked off and progress.

It may be procedural generation, but for me, knowing that the game world isn't concrete set and is just being created in the background as I go along, that lessens the impact for me.  They were trying to make you feel special like you stumbled upon a world or some feature that no one else has seen, but it's just the engine throwing random crap at you.  What incentive do I have, other than a few extra credits, to name my discoveries?  Oh I found a new species of mushroom called Vergaboichthalzwhatchamacallit... who cares unless you're the Charles Darwin of open world games?  It doesn't help that the randomness is very shallow and the themes repetitious, at least in my 6-7 hrs of play time so far.  Maybe it really opens up later, but my overall impression is that the juice isn't worth the squeeze on this high ambitious but ultimately flawed adventure.  I guess it boils down to what type of game you are expecting NMS to be, considering the extreme hype surrounding everything, and also what kind of gamer you are.  It's just not a game that I think about and can't wait to pick up again like some others.

It looked incredible and I decided to get it the following day. The first hour or so of the game was quite exhilarating. Starting the game on an alien planet with your ship damaged and being left to your own devices to solve the problem without being led by the hand is really tense and fun. Overcoming the first handful of hurdles in the game is the best part of the game, there is a genuine sense of danger and discovery. Unfortunately the first hour of gameplay is basically all you continue to do for the rest of the experience; fixing ship, exosuit and weapon parts by mining minerals from planets surfaces and creating items that will let you warp to the next solar system. Every planet is new in the sense that the colours are different, the conditions vary and the flora and fauna are generated randomly from a pool of variables. This is pretty cool to see initially, but you soon realise that there is just no reason for any of this. There is no real game here, only an exploration sim that lures you in with mystery. I do have to admit that the mystery is pretty enticing, but the gameplay elements of this game are extremely lazy so playing isn't exactly tons of fun. There is very little to actually do and the lack of variation is truly disappointing. The game has nice presentation for the most part; the music is fantastic, the colours, the lack of loading screens, it feels extremely vast but this comes at a price. While the planets are huge and the amount of space travel you can undertake mirrors the vastness of our actual universe, there really isn't much to see on planets apart from the rock formations and plants. You will not see anything that you haven't already seen except with variations in placement, over and over again. While the vastness is quite awe inspiring, the actual graphics aren't anything to write home about. In fact, they're quite obviously dated. Space fights are quite satisfying when you win but mostly because they're so awkwardly designed that you're surprised to even be able to pull them off. The fact that you have to recharge your ship in the inventory menu during battles through a series of navigations and clicks while combat continues unpaused is a head scratching choice. The puzzles in the game are very simple, mostly either multiple choice riddles or numeric ones. I've seen the same type of numeric riddle with exactly the same numbers three times already and it's things like this that make you question just how much forethought went into this. As a game, this fails. As a technical achievement, it succeeds to a certain extent, but once the brief initial excitement of flying from a planet into outer space has worn off there isn't much to marvel at apart from some pretty colours. It seems to me that this game is primarily trying to be an exploration simulator with philosophical undertones and it gets some things right and some things wrong, but the main issue is the lack of what's on offer to do. Exploring shouldn't be this repetitive and it shouldn't yield such a small plethora of results. The fact that this is being sold as a $60 game is cheeky. There isn't $60 worth of content here. If this game was $20 or less I might be fairly satisfied but honestly, if you have a limited budget for gaming I would definitely not spend your money on this game, I don't totally regret doing so as I really wanted to check it out as I love science fiction and mystery, but I do feel a bit cheated by the price."], ["Crackfarmer", "User", "4", "So after 5 hours of playing this i can say that i pretty much saw everything in this Game.

I gave a 10 for 2 reasons: the exploratory component and the infinite potential of the basic formula of this game .

It turns out that this is a simple mathmatical formula that indicates the number of potential planets you could interact with.  What that ends up equating to is that you have many planets that are essentially the same with only mild variations.

Plus not to mention exploring and time it takes to get places in the game play was ridiculous! Even when you did collect enough resources to get an upgrade, it was a sad disappointment. Even upgrading your own ship, which is a big accomplishment in the game, offered nothing special except more slots for mindless resources. Even the fighting gameplay with your ship is very difficult and almost impossible to hit a target flying through space with you. This game was defiantly not for a person like myself.

Let me simply begin by stating that I intend to be completely honest with this review. Contrary to the multitude of extremely negative reviews, this game is NOT a bad game. It is by no means perfect, and has a multitude of flaws, however, overall it is a fun and unique experience unlike anything currently on the market. The biggest problem with the game is not the game in and of itself, but more so the way that the game was perceived by the gaming community. When No Man's Sky was first introduced to the public several years ago, hype went through the roof. The beautiful setting, a promise of billions of varied planets, and new and unique game elements such as naming discovered planets and creatures as well as seamless planet surface to orbit spaceship travel all seemed too good to be true. While the trailer did an excellent job of amazing us, it was also rather vague and mysterious. This led to people interpreting the game in all sorts of different ways. Some people imagined massive planetary shoot-outs. Others imagined roaming the stars with friends. Some imagined encountering massive alien cities and deep, complex character side quests within these cities. Because of an initial lack of clarification with what this game actually was meant to be... this game became all things to all people, and our expectations exceeded what was ever even possible or meant to be. Hello Games did try to tone down the hype, explaining that their would be no giant cities, multiplayer would be nigh impossible, and procedural generation would prevent any \"scripted\" story line. However, this came a bit late, and at this point people's imaginations had taken over. No Man's Sky had become more than an upcoming game, it had become an idea. The idea that a small studio, which actually cared about it's fans, could create a masterpiece that would out-do even the richest of AAA developers. A game that would have everything. A game that would redefine gaming as we know it. Their was no way that this game could ever live up to such lofty expectations, and now fans are faced with the reality that this wasn't the game that \"they\" as individuals had imagined. While Hello Games tried to tone down the hype and explain that this was primarily an exploration game, people already had their own views of what this game \"would and should be\" stuck in their heads. When I began playing, I too had my lofty expectations. I really did hope for an infinite space Skyrim/ Minecraft  of sorts. However, when I was able to take a step back, and play this game the way that developers had intended for me to play it, rather than the way I had imagined it would be, I found that the game was actually rather good. It may not have been what I wanted or expected, but that didn't mean it was bad. I enjoy being able to go down to a planet and not know what to expect. When you do find other intelligent species (NPC's) scattered sparsely throughout the galaxy it's a cool and rewarding experience. Their are A LOT of things to do, some more in depth than others. The complaint that their isn't enough to do is a rather silly one in my opinion. I've spent hours of fun exploring just one planet, and never getting bored. I've searched caves for rare materials, looked for outposts where I've come across some very interesting NPC scientists, found a distress signal pointing to ruins of an ancient civilization, searched ancient glyphs to learn a new alien language, found chests filled with ship, suit, and weapon upgrade blueprints, documented mushroom deer, come across outposts that had been abandoned hastily in response to what appeared to be experiments gone wrong, Found giant Alien Monoliths which have... done.... something.... cool? and more. And that was all on one planet. This game may not be what you imagined, but it is not bad. Not bad at all.

The second piece of science missing is that some basic physics like orbits (day/night cycles) seem to be missing.

There isn't much of a story and there simply wont be. The interviews and such have stated it has cinematics and such to start, but is a survival game and a single player experience where you may come across another player later on. It mostly is gathering resources, exploring planets, and getting new species discovered while looking for technology and surviving....That may turn away some people, but for me that is the experience I wanted.

You can't form an opinion about the game after only playing two hours. After playing for 7-10 hours I have discovered that the game has a lot of depth when it comes to the game especially with the alien races. You don't instantly understand what they are saying to you so you rely on visiting obelisk and talking to them in order to gain knowledge and learn the language. The depth is when you explore more into these alien races. The large obelisk monuments are obscure and mysterious but reveal information that adds to the experience. For example I encountered an alien race of Gek in a system, they look reptilian or amphibious like, have an awful smell, and are very fond of trading and consider your character as a customer. While venturing around the world I came across a bit of knowledge from an obelisk about the Gek. I won't reveal what was said but it was an amazing bit of information that I learned about the species and it made me look at the alien species a different way and interact with them differently. Another species I came across was the Korvok which is a alien species that may or may not be robotic. The Korvoks are highly intelligent and focus on studying plant and animal species. They enjoy acquiring information and think of you as a test subject. There is an even larger narrative in play in this game and I think we haven't given the game enough time to discover everything it holds. The Atlas Station is also extremely mysterious and I think there are things that will be discovered in the future.

I do feel like I spend more time in these menus then exploring the planets I visited. For anyone who is looking for realistic, sharp graphics No Man Sky does not have them. However, the art style they use in the game makes it forgiving. I have put in over 15 hours into this game and I already found it becoming very repetitive within the first 3-6 hours. The things the I think it does well is the feeling of discovering something that may not be discovered by other players will keep on pulling you back. As well a plant life and animals that you find along your way. The first few hours are very slow, but it's worth it because all the small little items you find will help you build better parts for your ship.

But if you ignore the hype, ignore the exceptionally high expectations, what you are left with is a game that completely fulfills its intended purpose of appeasing interstellar wanderlust.

It is a terrifying and curious testament to what it means to be human in this universe. It intrigues and fascinates us. All the while reminding us of how small and insignificant we must be in a place so extensively vast. I am fueled by a hunger for knowledge.

I can list a million differences I'd have made. But can any of us truly thing of a game we wouldn't at least change something about? I firmly believe that this games problem was an overshot of their market. Far too much anticipation on a far too massive scale. If the game makers had remained humble, and didn't try to oversell it, I believe we'd see a much different response. This is not a game for everyone. And it should not have been marketed as such.

That's all and good for a mechanic to progress in the game, but there is never anything to look forward to progressing towards. The center of the galaxy is a very abstract goal, and not one that makes the journey feel important. There is a sense of pointlessness to progressing in No Man's Sky.

Exploration, discovery, adventure, and variation have always been the four aspects I deemed essential to an open-world experience, so while looking at No Man's Sky, a game which technically tries to deliver on all four of these aspects, I want to determine what differentiates this game from something like Breath of the Wild or Red Dead Redemption. Both of which I believe are the best of the best in all four of these areas. In terms of variety, I think where No Man's Sky fails is how it executes its variation with gameplay. The fact that it is procedurally generated means that this game will undeniably have easily distinguishable wildlife and environments, so in this area above all others, I thought the game would be able to execute it correctly. However all the variation is completely surface level. None of it changes the way you approach the game or traverse an area, and all it does is make some areas cumbersome to navigate. Now look at Breath of the Wild, the complete opposite of No Man's Sky in this perspective. Most of these shrines may look the same, but the variety in the micro-challenges and small puzzles they present you with work wonders to make them fresh and constantly surprising. The environments aren't just designed that way because that looks the best, their variation forces the player to make different preparations or use different gear and weapons depending on which they plan on venturing into. Traversing mountainous areas is completely different from traversing Hyrule Field because they're both laid out completely differently and require different techniques to move through them. This helped by the large selection of rewards one can hope to find. This directly ties to No Man's Sky's hours upon hours of exploration. Exploring is the very purpose of No Man's Sky, and is the core gameplay from which everything else stems. In this, No Man's Sky fails because, the only goal in the game is to mine for materials. Occasionally there will be a new creature or environment that may be visually interesting, however they all act essentially identically to every other creature and environment in the game. There is no purpose to simply exploring and looking for things of interest in No Man's Sky, because there will never be anything out of the ordinary to find. Nothing that offers anything more than a new sky-box to mine things in. Nothing ever feels new or surprising, so the discovery aspect completely fails as well. Red Dead Redemption, by contrast, differentiates every town and landmark due to the activities one is able to do there. No Man's Sky, however briefly, does understand this. The first hour of this game easily delivers one of the strongest feelings of exploration in any game as the player is able to go wherever they wish and do whatever they wish, until they realize that wherever they go, everything they do is a carbon copy of whatever it was they were doing before. The sheer fact that mining is the core gameplay mechanic in No Man's Sky simultaneously hinders the game's feeling of adventure, which requires a feeling of progression and journey. The easiest way for a game hoping to achieve this feeling is to demonstrate that the player is strong enough to take down foes that were deadly at the beginning of the game. With a goal in mind, a player can feel a sense of adventure by taking their own steps to accomplish that goal. The very purpose of Breath of the Wild is to deliver an adventure. The player can nearly constantly see Hyrule Castle, and thus are always reminded of their goal as they go about preparing for it in whatever way they deem necessary. In terms of what I value in an open-world game, No Man's Sky is an abject failure, and despite how amazing the initial half-an-hour to an hour was, I still cannot justify giving No Man's Sky any score higher than a 2 out of 10."], ["Dioga", "User", "2", "NO MANS LIE"], ["jugadorhardcore", "User", "0", "This is the crap of the crap Companies greedy at it best...

A very good design of weapons, characters, enemies and abilities give us a very good game that the hardcore gamers could enjoy."], ["Gamer.nl", "Critic", "85", "Nuclear Throne works you until you finally climb that throne.

It's one of the hardest, most rewarding games I've ever played. But as satisfying as it can eventually become, I think it is far too demanding for its own good.

Each time you play you'll go pretty much through the same areas, but each time it's \"randomly\" generated, different projectile and melee weapon drops, as well as mutations, to choose from.
