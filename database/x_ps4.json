It freezes, crashes, Ironman is almost unplayable. Near the end of the game I'm seeing a consistent 2-3 minute load screen after a level, followed by another screen with a mission summary with loading again. I might be a bit biased because I think the first few games killed the idea of overwhelming alien superiority and sent you into combat with 14 soldiers against 4 aliens and it was a tough go.

I found that Soldiers that had a 40% chance to hit their targets did so much more often that the times my soldiers had a 90% hit chance.
